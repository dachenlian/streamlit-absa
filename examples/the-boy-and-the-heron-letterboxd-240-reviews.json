        "review": "How does someone follow one of the greatest and most profoundly summative farewells the movies have ever seen? By definition, they don’t. They retire, or they die. Or they retire and then they die. In some rare cases, it even seems like they die because they retired.And then there’s 82-year-old filmmaker and Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, always in a category of his own, who’s formally or informally quit the business no fewer than seven times of the course of his illustrious career, most recently after the 2013 release of his magnum opus “The Wind Rises.” A fictionalized biopic about aeronautical engineer Jiro Horikoshi, whose most visionary designs were built with forced Korean labor and deployed at the wasteful mercy of Japan’s World War II campaign, the film doubled as a devastatingly raw self-portrait of an artist struggling to reconcile the cost and value of his own creations — to reconcile the purity of his imagination, and the violence required to make it real.It was the Ozymandian signoff of a cinematic titan looking on his works, ye mighty, with despair, and straining to convince himself that the ugliness of our world doesn’t invalidate the beauty of our dreams so much as the beauty of our dreams validates the ugliness of our world. “The wind is rising,” Horikoshi concludes, quoting a poem from the French writer Paul Valéry as he watches one of his glorious planes glide through the air. “We must try to live.” The only question that remained, of course, was how.It was a question “The Wind Rises” posed implicitly but also rhetorically, as Miyazaki knew that it was also one that everyone would have to answer for themselves. And by “everyone,” I mean everyone; try as he might, the self-torturing Miyazaki just couldn’t let himself off the hook.The movie world’s least convincing retiree had made a film that was clearly meant to serve as the period at the end of his peerless career, and yet he couldn’t help but turn its final moments into a taunting ellipsis. Shocked as some (i.e. me) were by the announcement that Miyazaki would dare to make another movie after “The Wind Rises,” that shock immediately softened into the stuff of head-shaking inevitability when the title of his new last movie was revealed in October 2017. It would, of course, be called “How Do You Live?” It would be the ultimate statement from someone who had left himself no choice but to make it before he left us for good — someone who had to unretire, for the eighth and final time, in order to die on his own terms.Needless to say, he wasn’t thrilled about that. “There’s nothing more pathetic than telling the world you’ll retire because of your age, then making another comeback,” Miyazaki wrote upon starting work on “How Do You Live?” (excerpts from his journal were included in the film’s press notes). “Is it truly possible to accept how pathetic that is, and do it anyway? Doesn’t an elderly person deluding themself that they’re still capable, despite their geriatric forgetfulness, prove that they’re past their best? You bet it does.”Well, yes and no. It’s true that “How Do You Live?” — which tells an original story that borrows its title from Genzaburo Yoshino’s 1937 novel of the same name, and has been inexplicably rechristened “The Boy and the Heron” for its international release at Studio Ghibli’s behest… despite the fact that Yoshino’s book acts as a crucial plot point in a film whose climax hinges upon an obvious stand-in for its writer-director literally asking the audience “How do you live?” — isn’t Miyazaki’s best film. It lacks the full kineticism of “The Castle of Cagliostro,” the fury of “Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind,” the adventure of “Castle in the Sky,” the Totoro of “My Neighbor Totoro,” the effervescence of “Kiki’s Delivery Service,” the romance of “Porco Rosso,” the grandeur of “Princess Mononoke,” the beguilement of “Spirited Away,” the floridness of “Howl’s Moving Castle,” the hamminess of “Ponyo,” or the emotional mega-wattage of “The Wind Rises.”Crucially, however, “The Boy and the Heron” contains aspects of all of those things (in addition to more overt references to the anime godhead’s previous work). And while this dream-like warble of a swan song may be too pitchy and scattered to hit with the gale-force power that made “The Wind Rises” feel like such a definitive farewell, “The Boy and the Heron” finds Miyazaki so nakedly bidding adieu — to us, and to the crumbling kingdom of dreams and madness that he’ll soon leave behind — that it somehow resolves into an even more fitting goodbye, one graced with the divine awe and heart-stopping wistfulness of watching a true immortal make peace with their own death.~this review continues on IndieWire~"

        "review": "An accumulation of everything Hayao Miyazaki has gifted us throughout his incredible career. An epic finale and an emotional goodbye to his beloved world, characters, and magic.Watching this in theaters without having absolutely no information about the film was surreal. It's nearly impossible nowadays to go watch a movie without having any sort of information about it, whether it's a poster, trailer, music, or teaser, so this was an incredibly refreshing and valuable experience. The shock and excitement of not knowing anything made me giddy. I braced myself, but I was not ready.The nostalgia of all of Miyazaki's works can be felt throughout as well as a sense of deja vu, as if you have walked the same landscape in your dreams. I kept repeating the title in my head, trying to read between the lines and grasp what Miyazaki was saying to us, trying to answer the question \"How DO you live?\".It was an embrace of both life and death, the gruesome cruelty of the world, and the desire to have hope, to hang on to and preserve the little beauty that is left. A graceful acceptance of the finite and the passage of time. A bittersweet goodbye to a legend and a brave welcome of the newer, younger generation. The torch has been passed."

        "review": "Once again, Miyazaki managed to thoroughly immerse me in his intricate, strange, and unfathomably inventive world. Without a doubt, a self-reflective piece, and a film that manages to highlight every aspect in which he shines. a fairy-tale-like film with Miyazaki bringing key personal lessons into the medium of animation. It does, admittedly, cover a lot of ground. Perhaps too much at points. It enters multiple portals, many of which become incoherent and difficult to follow at times. However, within moments, I felt a sense of ease and passion. Maybe not his best work, but it's still a great film nonetheless."

        "review": "Undeniably (in part, at least) a self-referential victory lap in conversation with so much of Miyazaki's history of imaginative, expressive dream worlds, so much so that I could see some finding this either a nice warm bath they were happy to return to and others maybe simply derivative of things he's already done better. Personally, I was really taken with of course being back inside this animation style and material but also the feelings of aging precarity and collapse that have been baked into them. It opens on a smeary, fiery trauma that will serve to ground its coming-of-age through cathartic fantasy storytelling you've seen him do before—complete with all the lovingly rendered watercolor landscapes, strange, supernatural world/creature design, and another unreal Joe Hisaishi score that will make you tear up even out of context of the images—and positions its childlike wonder and excitement against the abandoned majesty of this particular world which is old, unbalanced, and created by a man \"who read too many books and went insane\" ages ago. In typical Miyazaki fashion, in between all the astonishing beauty and tenderness on display, we spend a lot of time considering how the labor of this place works, the sadness of its food chain, its odd fablelike quality (that operates between scary and moving at any given moment) and observations of the careful ways we are all connected and effect/need one another, and eventually come to the realization that sometimes beautiful living, breathing things simply come to an end and that's ok. Sometimes there's no one to pass the baton on to and people are just happy befriending the ugliest bird you've ever seen in your life. Or maybe this is all just a metaphor for his son's failed filmmaking career. Up in the air. Regardless, funniest anti-parakeet propaganda movie of all time."

But I think that it's evident from the first frame all the way to the last that Miyazaki is making this film like he's at the end of his life. Every frame of the film is maybe among the most beautifully animated that we'll ever see in a long while, but at the same time, I think that it's nice being able to see Miyazaki entering a very self-reflective phase late within his career - resulting in some of the most emotional moments of his own career.And really, it's just absolutely incredible in every sense of the word. What a movie, full stop.Reviewed for Cinema from the Spectrum"

        "review": "Saw this in IMAX on the second day of release.The Hayao Miyazaki brand finally collapses in on itself as he tries to manage a late-stage swan-song.The Boy and the Heronis Miyazaki playing the hits, with its swirl of classic staples: wartime Japan, fascism, wrinkled old women, memory, nostalgia, delicious looking food, family, growing up, little circular creatures that will be sold as merchandise, and his seeming lifelong fascination with older woman/young boy juxtapositions.None of these themes, however, seem to congeal into anything interesting or worthwhile, even with the addition of almost Jodorowskian psychedelic flavors that seem to border on horror. We get what seems like a (as much as I loathe the term) 'multiverse' to play with, replete with rows of doors to different worlds, but never a reason for these places to exist. I'm not asking for detailed worldbuilding, for lore dumps, or even for rote exposition. I can appreciate hashtag-vibes as much as anyone else! The lack of... anything, really, to work with just ends up leaving everything feeling unmoored. Everything is a reference to something else, a reminder of something much better, and nothing is new or exciting.The strange, uneven pacing doesn't help much either: it begins slowly, teasing an ease-in to something bigger, but then it seems to just... coast onwards once the action begins, never setting up any coherent plot trajectory or resolution until we suddenly swerve into metaphysics, then everything happens, and then everything is fine. Our protagonist accepts his step-mother as his mother! Then the movie slams shut. Did we really need those 3 cuts of slightly further in the future?I'm not particularly interested in whatever ideas Miyazaki seems to be trying to communicate through the God-director-expy in the film. Truly, it is so difficult being a creative genius and trying to find someone to carry on the grueling work of being amazing before just saying 'Fuck it, whatever. I'm too old for this, the kids will probably be alright.' and dying. Old man yells at cloud.I feel bad just slamming this movie when it's not actually unwatchable or anything, so let me mention some positives: as far as eye candy goes, it's some of the tastiest: the painterly style of the backgrounds lends each frame an unbelievable richness. I'd be more than happy to just stare at the backgrounds for another two hours. The set-pieces might feel a bit weak when viewed as components of a greater whole, but they are without a doubt captivating and entertaining in the moment, with Miyazaki's knack for action scenes still shining through. Ghibli's animation is as excellent as ever, remaining consistently high-quality throughout the whole of the film.Of particular note are the first 10-15 minutes of the film, which offer a glimmer of something much better. The dazzlingly animated vignette of wartime Japan has some of the most powerful experimental animation I've seen on the big screen sinceInu-Oh's depiction of blindness. It more than justifies the price of admission in and of itself.To sum up my feelings on the whole affair, it's a beautiful-looking film that, if you have any interest in animation as a medium, you should be seeing on the biggest screen possible. There's not much inside, though, once you break that shell, except parts of much better films and unfinished sketches, taped together on layout sheets. If the presumptuous marketing strategy is anything to go by, Miyazaki's finally made a movie with its entire reason for existing seeming to be \"I'm Miyazaki\"."

        "review": "君たちはどう生きるか [KIMITACHI WA DOU IKIRU KA]As a child, Miyazaki Hayao’s father managed a plane factory during World War II, and his mother was sick. That’s all I’ll say of the plot.The opening is, to me, the most interesting part of the film—it’s also the most easily understood by anybody watching. The main character, whose name I won’t even share with you, speaks maybe 10 short lines in the first act. Miyazaki is operating in a new mode here for his last final, slower and more quiet than evenThe Wind Rises. For perhaps the first time, he lets emotion supersede form—in a standout opening sequence, he allows his characters to break their usually-on-model designs and blurs them along with the backgrounds to create more impressionistic scenes that depict what is decidedly the most real(istic) moment of the film and, even at the beginning of the very end of it all, a career standout.My Japanese isn’t the best, so I’ll need to rewatch this to pick up some more of what was explicitly happening in the rest of the film (as opposed to what random words I could gather in relation to the imagery), but I found it engaging and enjoyable; the film felt as thoughThe Wind RisesandSpirited Awaywere mashed together, although I might end up being totally wrong about that once I can actually piece together the script. Bird enjoyers will love this film.It’s a surreal and wonderful experience to be able to watch a Studio Ghibli movie directed by Miyazaki on opening day in Japan, compounded doubly by the fact that (1) this is likely actually the very last one he’ll make and (2) it skipped festivals to premiere here in Japan. I sat in a packed theater at 1 PM on a Friday, too; this did not need the marketing that it didn’t receive. I am a lucky man.And I thank this great master of film once more."

        "review": "An overwhelming experience. I still need some days or weeks to let this set in. No matter what the story, characters turned out to be, I knew this would be an honor to see another eternal work from the master. Hayao Miyazaki is perhaps the greatest film MAKER of all time. No other career or body of work has cemented itself as individual statements, and as a collective. It's hard to believe it's been a decade since his last film, The Wind Rises.This film is so wholly unique, but if I did have to make a comparison, it'd be to Spirited Away. The Boy and the Heron is a wonderful companion piece. An existential odyssey on a cosmic scale. Where Spirited Away explores the world of the unseen, afterlife, and beyond, The Boy and the Heron ventures through time, purgatory, and tackles themes like overcoming grief.This film contains some of the most incredible images not only in a Miyazaki film, but in any film, period. The opening scene had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. This is perhaps the most impressive film Ghibli has put out, on a technical level - the sound design particularly immersive and powerful. Several moments where the sound mix itself gave me chills. And finally, the score by my favorite composer, Joe Hisaishi, is one of his very best. There were certain moments of the score that I wished went even grander, to really meet the visuals.Really curious to see how a second watch changes my perception on the film. It did feel longer than its runtime, and the pacing was sometimes disjointed for me. But I tend to feel this with new Miyazaki films since his work resemble dreams / nightmares more than movies or literature. They don't really feel confined by any structure. The dream logic is real within the walls of this film, and makes for such a fun ride. Ghibli Ranked List coming soon."

A fantastical & emotional journey across space & time with many bizarre elements adding layer upon layer of depth & creativity. Hayao Miyazaki’s final film may not be his best but it’s better than most others out there and as perfect as a thematic note to go out on anyone could’ve hoped for. Highly imaginative, funny & gorgeous to gaze upon with a beautiful sounding score by Joe Hisaishi."

        "review": "I'll try to write a shorter and spoiler-free review this time, and perhaps a longer version after the international release or when it's available on demand.First of all, I'd like to say that I prefer the original Japanese title, \"How Do You Live?\" It directly conveys the movie's central theme. Unless they named it to mislead the audience and maintain a sense of mystery, the original title is a whole lot better in my opinion.The long awaited “The Boy and the Heron,” directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, is a mesmerizing tale that showcases the magic of storytelling through animation. With a stellar voice acting cast that brings the characters to life, the film immerses you in a world of imagination and wonder. This film is a testament to Miyazaki’s storytelling prowess, offering a heartfelt and enchanting narrative that transcends age boundaries. It’s a delightful cinematic experience that reminds us of the enduring power of storytelling and the beauty of the natural world. It’s fanfuckingtastic, But is it his career best? I don't think so.The score, composed by the talented maestro Joe Hisaishi, is a symphony of emotions that enhances every scene. Hisaishi’s music has the power to transport you to the heart of the story, making you feel every emotion, from the soaring highs to the tender lows 🔥 even makes me think of Kanye’s Runaway 💀 a single piano note that creates strong feelings 😩 (Spotify when 🙏🙏🙏)If I were to point out a drawback, it's that the ending feels a bit abrupt and sudden. I didn't want this movie to end so quickly 😫You guys are not prepared for this 😩 There are many adorable characters in it, cuteness overload 💦 that makes you want to live in the movie's world. But that heron is really creepy 💀 and it has some elements that are somewhat like a horror film in the first half 💀If you're a fan of Miyazaki's previous films, you might love this one. Highly recommended to everyone, and it's family-friendly 🗣️Oh! There are some echoes of Miyazaki’s earlier works within this film. If you’ve seen them all, you’ll certainly recognize many similarities!"

        "review": "‘The question the film’s Japanese title poses lingers throughout the experience. How do you live? On the shoulders of those who came before you. After decades of defining the animation industry in Japan, Miyazaki has accepted his fate. This is ultimately a story about the hows and whys that define our memory, a recognition that no existence can live without building upon the inventions, experiences, and memories of those who came before us. A recognition that to move forward means to move on and let go of the past while keeping their memories and lessons close for the next person to carry that torch.’Check out my full review over onThe Verge.This is just… incredible. And, it exists! After all the silence you wouldn’t know it, but it’s real! And the end of an era."

While it isn’t the greatest work he’s ever has, The Boy and the Heron does a fantastic job and serves its purpose well as the last dance in Miyazaki’s career. A heartwarming and infectious film. Has lots of emotional and heart moments to it. Hayao  Myazaki doing what he does best… showing us these unbelievable worlds with lovable characters and unique stories of love and acceptance. Miyazaki will go down as an all time great and will never be forgotten. I would one hundred percent recommend to anyone, but too the crybaby’s bring tissues.Overall really good4/5"

        "review": "Already acclaimed as a masterpiece in Japan, Hayao Miyazaki’s new film begins as a simple story of loss and love, and rises to a staggering work of imagination. Coming after the maker ofSpirited AwayandPrincess Mononokeannounced his retirement,The Boy and the Heronis an especially precious gift, and possibly the final film we will see from one of cinema’s greatest artists.As a boy, Miyazaki read Genzaburo Yoshino’s novelHow Do You Live?and embraced it as his favourite. This film was initially announced as an adaptation of that book, but Miyazaki uses it instead as one of many layers in a dazzling tapestry that draws even more upon his own youth.During the Second World War, young Mahito Maki (Soma Santoki) suffers a heartbreaking family tragedy and must move immediately to the countryside, where his father (Takuya Kimura) works for a family making planes for Japan’s military, as Miyazaki’s own father did.Isolated, Mahito begins exploring the mysterious landscapes and encounters a grey heron, persistent in its presence. The boy also happens upon an abandoned tower. Curious, he enters. From there,The Boy and the Heronexpands into a wondrous, often-startling phantasmagoria.Visually, the film shows Miyazaki at the height of his powers, filling the frame with gorgeous compositions, vibrant colour, and arresting movement. As it draws you deeper into its mysteries,The Boy and the Heronbecomes richer, stranger, and more profoundly beautiful. This is a singular, transformative experience in film, and not to be missed.--Add this film to your Watchlist and check out moreOfficial Selection titlescoming to the 48th annual Toronto International Film Festival.

This really does feel like a culmination of Miyazaki's work, he pulls elements from so many of his films for this, yet he manages to still keep it uniquely original and completely it's own thing. Absolutely one of his most mature films and thematically it can be very heavy but also very powerful. An absolutely beautiful film, both aesthetically and emotionally. Miyazaki continues to be one of the best to ever do it."

Words can't capture how special and magical this is — not only does it play out as a labyrinthine dreamscape from which waking up feels like an impossibility, but also a reflective look at one's reconciliation with the inevitable that drives the movie to the level where conventional narration is no longer relevant. Literally, how do you live knowing one day, the master's going to hang up his sword forever?"

        "review": "An undeniable feast for the eyes, every frame so meticulously detailed and bursting with color and creativity — in other words, par for the course for a Miyazaki film. Story wise, it’s mid tier for him, the plot to scattershot, emotional arcs sometimes overwhelmed by the surrounding visual world-building. It too often feels like certain things are happening for the sake of being weird rather than serving as natural extensions of the characters’ journeys. But there’s certainly a lot to appreciate in the self reflective storytelling here, and the sheer sense of wonder that the film conjures — both when it expands the world and in its simpler, more tranquil first act — helps smooth over certain engagement issues. At the end of the day, I’d rather a film bite off more than it can chew thematically rather than take the safe route, especially when it's being helmed by a master like Miyazaki.GRADE: B"

Or let me ask the different way: How do you live with announcing your retirement two times and then going back to making films at the age of 82? Despite Miyazaki officially dedicated this film to his grandson I think this is his last love letter and goodbye to his mother.Also, an emotional and collective goodbye to his limitless world and beloved characters. I'm just so happy to join in this adventure for the second viewing in theaters despite going through the most chaotic time of the year (work, work, work). It's kinda weird that after seeing Miyazaki' documentary, it inspired me to work constantly and passionately. Like the maestro says ''It's the ultimate hassle.

The demolition of idealisms (the legacy one has carefully built over a lifetime), how quickly they vanish, the impulse to begin again—but it is too late, the bombs have dropped and a new generation must face the chaos you tried to avoid your entire life.Is this (in 2023) what it felt like to watch the final films of Ford, Minnelli, Lang, Hitchcock, etc. in 1966? The last Miyazakis, the last Scorseses, the last Godards, the last Vardas, the last Erices, the last Loaches, the last Bellocchios....I'm reminded of Scorsese's moving complaint inDeadline: \"I wish I could take a break for eight weeks and make a film at the same time [laughs]. The whole world has opened up to me, but it’s too late. It’s too late. I’m old. I read stuff. I see things. I want to tell stories, and there’s no more time. Kurosawa, when he got his Oscar, when George [Lucas] and Steven [Spielberg] gave it to him, he said, 'I’m only now beginning to see the possibility of what cinema could be, and it’s too late.' He was 83. At the time, I said, 'What does he mean?' Now I know what he means.\" Now, Miyazaki, too, finally sees what he can do with cinema: and, it turns out, he is only beginning."

I could look at the visual intricacies of each frame for days on end. The disorderly, and at times, borderline nonsensical storyline is challenging. To fully comprehend all the metaphors laced into The Boy and The Heron’s plot, you’ll undoubtably have to see it many times over.

I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say he’s the second greatest director to ever come out of Japan, and probably one of the all-time most influential directors globally. His body of work and his ability to convey themes in his own surreal and unique way will forever hold a special significance to me and millions around the world. I honestly don’t think he has a single mistake in his filmography especially when we’re talking about his work with Studio Ghibli.This film is a salvia trip and more.Felt like a compilation of every film he ever created, it’s confusing and beautiful and probably his most visually stunning work, which says a lot. Also, definitely felt like a farewell as if Hayao Miyazaki is talking to himself about the world he created and the world we know. The story structure is very strange and it’s difficult to understand certain aspects of the narrative and world building but I think this film can only get better on rewatch.Overall,Most Studio ghibli film to ever be produced by Studio Ghbili, almost an homage to one of the most iconic filmmakers to ever set foot in our world. Everything from the music to the visuals, themes and to the weirdly paced story is outstanding. A must see!"

        "review": "There's something special about watching a Hayao Miyazaki movie in theatres. However, seeing a new release in a packed theater is even more magical. When I saw the Studio Ghibli logo and heard the crowd erupt in applause, I felt a sense of comfort. Within minutes, this comfort was replaced by overwhelming emotion when tears wished to form without knowing why. Perhaps this is due to Joe Hisaishi's (unsurprisingly) beautiful score. Moreover, it's a testament to Miyazaki's entire body of work — this rich world of stories he has woven, and the countless memories that flood back at once.SinceThe Boy and the Heronwas announced suddenly and without press, I think it would do the film a disservice to discuss its plot. Trust me, go into this one completely blind (although, perhaps, take a moment to read a bit about Miyazaki's background and upbringing). It's a very personal movie for the filmmaker. In addition to touching on his grief and regrets, the film also reminds us of Miyazaki's age and impact — his kingdom isn't going to last forever. And so, this is where the film's original title,How Do You Live?comes into play. The legacy Miyazaki leaves behind is an invitation to build on it.I can see why this film may frustrate some. It ends abruptly, and some loose ends remain. This was my initial reaction, as well. As I strolled home and thought about the movie's message, my love for it only grew, and it felt bittersweet. In the same way that things cannot end ideally, sometimes they cannot be carried on. And if that's the case, that's alright, too. How do we live? How do we come to terms with what we've lost? What makes us human in the midst of all our grief? Maybe all we can do is strive towards spreading compassion, much like Miyazaki does in his filmography. This isn't a swan song, but it sure felt like one."

In fact, early on I began to wonder if the animation was crowding out the story and tone. But of course, it's all a feint; this may well be the most confidently Miyazaki has ever drawn out a narrative, one that feels wafer-thin until it suddenly takes on an escalating density of ideas that multiple viewings are mandatory to pack out the holistic worldview being offered here. Death is always a part of Miyazaki's work, but not evenPrincess Mononokedepicts it as unsparingly as this, with blood seeping out of wounds in viscous streams and creatures displaced by literal and figurative climate change wreaking havoc on ecosystems thrown off by the introduction of new predators and prey.But even as the film refuses to settle for turning a blind eye to such things, it puts forward a vision of accepting these grim changes while still working to make improvements, be they to the world or just one's own broken self.  Even a plot point that feels suspiciously like Miyazaki casting shade at Goro for being unable to keep up the family legacy of quality shows an acceptance of letting go of the idea of generational obligation and giving one's descendants the opportunity to grow on their own terms."

A message about accepting the inevitability of death and a portrayal of a very particular philosophy of life, about acceptance and self-forgiveness. Loaded with a message of mourning, it brings several analogies of life and specially life in war, with what seems to be a farewell from Miyazaki.One character in particular seems to personify the director. Through him, we seem to understand a message that goes beyond the film itself and talks about the director's entire filmography and the philosophy he imprinted on his own work.I particularly believe that it is a movie that we will only understand in its entirety once we have distanced ourselves from its release. It's one of those works that may seem average, but it has so many layers and meanings that it needs time to be fully appreciated. I do not LOVE it, but I like it a lot. It's very interesting in its own way.--------The Boy and The Heron é melancólico.

Much likeSpriited AwayandHowl's Moving Castle, the film revolves around the protagonist escaping their ordinary lives and entering a strange, magical world. It evokes childhood memories of exploring the backyard and letting your imagination run wild. The big difference this time is that the narrative is more complex and darker. It feels more artsy compared to Miyazaki's previous films. As expected from Miyazaki, the animation is beautiful and the emotional beats are in the right place.However, there are a few aspects that did underwhelm me. For one thing, the story didn't captivate me as much as it should've. Perhaps because of the narrative complexity, I felt some disconnect with the characters. I also found Joe Hisaishi's score to be underwhelming. It sounded so ordinary to me and nothing stands out as particularly memorable. It's more of a standard film score than a full-blown concerto. The film also has an abrupt ending, which is a frustrating gripe I have with Miyazaki as it's a common issue in his other films.Given his inability to retire, who knows if this is truly Miyazaki's last film. As a coda, it could've been better. But I'm glad this film exists. I'm blessed to have the privilege of seeing a newly released Miyazaki film in theaters because I'm not sure if I'll have this opportunity again."

The weirdness of his earlier films were founded on a certain logic, now it's like he's making up the rules as he goes along."

        "review": "TIFF#1*International Premiere*The godfather of anime, Hayao Miyazaki, comes out of retirement for what may be his last production and swan song, except the swan is... a heron.Not being a considerable anime fan nor a Miyazaki stan, let me explain as to why I am attending the hot ticket International Premiere. Back in June TIFF offered packages of guaranteed opening and closing gala tickets before the titles were ever announced - I took both to avoid last-minute scrambles, with THE BOY AND THE HERON eventually scheduled as the opener and the Sly documentary as the closer. With the hellish process of pre-sales and yet another year of Ticketmaster clusterducks (I’m using fowl language here) and TIFF Account Manager snafus, scalpers infiltrated the system and tickets were being resold at over $500 each. However, part of this early sale condition I bought into was that the tickets would be non-refundable and non-exchangeable for that very reason.What I am trying to say is that I apologize to any Miyazaki megafans out there - I know there are a lot of you - and that I do not take for granted the opportunity to be one of the first people to see this film outside of Japan, and I will try to give you enough of a review to whet your appetites for when it does come to a streamer or theatre near you. Who am I kidding... you’ll probably buy the gold-plated DVD when it’s out, and good on you for your passionate patronage.In my teens and early twenties, I always had anime-maniacs in my life, and numerous other cinephiles and film fanatics who would ramble on endlessly with entire plots and associated Ghibli gossip and origin stories whenever I mentioned I hadn’t yet seen something by the master.One year, in the midst of an intense obsessive phase centred on Billy Crudup, I asked my film buddy if we could watch the dubbed version of PRINCESS MONOKE so that I could complete my celebrity crush’s filmography. However, when I got to his place, as a purist he insisted on subtitles with the original version. I too, regularly abhor dubbing and insist on subtitles with each and every foreign language film, but that time and tonight were the exceptions. Why tonight? Well, because on the train from Montreal to Toronto I realized that despite a whole morning of OCD jitters and repeating out loud and asking friends via text “what am I forgetting?”, that I forgot my glasses at home in Montreal.Unlike other years, to speed up the purchasing process, seat selection was limited to premieres only and anything part of a package or regular admission ended up with randomly assigned seating... so instead of me living in the front row as I usually do, I am stuck way up in the balcony for numerous screenings. While I was Googling emergency optometrists in downtown Toronto, my great friend Laura - and my TIFF roomie’s fiancée - managed to meet up with my building manager and fetch the glasses from my apartment so that I will have them when she comes down to join us this weekend. Heroes do exist.Squinting at the subtitles from halfway back, and trying to change my brain and body from a night schedule to a day one, I possibly did miss some stuff, but I think I got the gist and importance of what may be the anime GOAT’s final feature.I keep on top of Hollywood and popular animated features and I can’t help but remark how the western and eastern styles of animation differ in relation to the bridge between adults and youth in their audience.In your standard Disney, Pixar or Illumination picture, you’re often watching two separate movies layered on top of each other - the straightforward and obvious plot for the kids and whole family, and the nostalgic hints and numerous inside jokes aimed at adults. They’re formulaic but most are well-constructed, witty and crowd-pleasing all around.In the classic anime features I have seen, it’s a mature story, journey or conflict that chronicles a youth’s transition into adulthood and adult themes... it’s not a dual package for two demographics, but a near-seamless bridge between the two.Western animation has some great coming-of-age themes but they’re often on the nose; TURNING RED was about raging hormones and female puberty and INSIDE OUT was about emotions, as some recent examples.What we get with Miyazaki is not a single theme in a tidy box. We get a convoluted but contemplative modern parable of everyday adventurers seeking out meaning in their life and experiences. The destination or the end revelation is not clear, the plot is unknown... much like, well... real life. When we set out on any life path, we can’t say for sure where’ll we end up. Embracing this uncertainty is a part of accepting independence and essentially, the first step to growing up. It’s often scary, often tedious, but a reflection of the lives that we are going to live.It’s this power of contemplation and meditation on life’s mysteries and meanings that forces us to unpack the film piece by piece. As in, it gets you thinking, and leaves you thinking. There are tons of films geared for adult audiences that are provocative and stay in your mind long after you’ve left the theatre, but how many of our young adult and family films invoke that same response? Watching films like this is equivalent to graduating from early readers to big chapter books, but bypassing the young adult section altogether.“The door to another world” from a harsh reality theme is common, with the more famous examples being Narnia, Neverending Story, Labyrinth and Pan’s Labyrinth. Like in two of these features and Miyazaki’s latest, a child in a wartime era needs a break from the real world. In the other two titles listed, the child needs a break from a struggling parental situation or a changing household dynamic, much like the Boy who after the loss of his mother, must welcome an expecting stepmother into his life and adjust to the home she has made and maintained.Similarly the early death or loss of a parent is a feature of many of these tales. PETITE MAMAN and SUZUME are recent examples among numerous detailing the quasi-supernatural mental digestion of such great grief by children. For some whom I spoke to after about the film, the Boy’s quest to find his mother in an imaginative limbo or underworld was the beating heart and saving grace of the film.So if neither of the above themes are particularly original given the plethora of young adult and family films that delve into these hardships, is THE BOY AND THE HERON saying or showing anything that hasn’t been shown before?I haven’t watched an extensive library of anime, nor read any manga... but I would say, yes.What’s with the heron, and why is it anthropomorphic? Why does it go from funny to mean? From flippant to testing? From fowl-mouthed to humanistic?The truth is, when it comes to the hard stuff, adults aren’t giving explanations to the children who can’t make sense of the awful or incomprehensible acts around them. No one is telling them the truth and the answers they deserve, on account of their age. Furthermore, no one is giving them complete comfort in a time or environment in which everyone involved is tense or anxious. The adults don’t want the children to worry, but it’s no relief to anyone to keep them in the dark as we so often do.Animals are the bridge between human adults and children; great middlekin who bring consistency and comfort to our existence, and to live despite not knowing all of the answers, and most importantly, the meaning of life.The animal figure which these kids encounter is the provider of warmth and connection they can’t achieve with adults, and often their own parents. Despite being animals with supposedly lower intelligence or at least on par with a young child, in literature we imbue an all-knowing wisdom to these normally voiceless creatures, and if we could only hear them speak we would know the secrets of the universe. So we get Aslan the lion in Narnia, and we get a harbinger and spirit guide heron here.Like in Narnia, films like these are generally a child’s first venture into spiritualism beyond that of the religion and beliefs of their parents. The Christian allegories are strong in C.S. Lewis’s work, but in other parts of the world many tales meant for children incorporate their own local mythologies and spiritual folklore.The animal figure aside from this evolved adult soul component, is also a child at heart; demanding attention, oversharing, and telling it like it is.What’s subversive about the animal figure in the heron is how temperamental and flawed he is, and as he shifts shape between a graceful heron to an awkward bird to a frumpy huge-nosed human, we see many sides to him - the good, the bad, the ugly. What makes that interesting is that the child he has sought out is able to see another being for all that they are - dynamic and nuanced, and not one-dimensional - mimicking the true nature of humanity.As children we desire above all consistency and strong character from our parents, and we haven’t come to see them as real people with faults and attributes that make them unique and individuals, and imperfect. After the boy, Mahito, journeys through the underworld with that hot mess of a magical Heron, he is more ready to accept the moods and questionable behaviour of his stepmother and late mother whom he intends to rescue in an Orpheus / Oedipus quest.Another subversive theme is individualism in a communist or conforming world. The Boy is attacked by an enormous flock of parakeets, a ginormous gaggle of pelicans, and a massive gang of other man-eating creatures or mythological beasts which I couldn’t identify or remember the name of... All of this strength in large numbers shows how hard it is to stand alone and strong in this world.Furthermore, in a wartime setting, as Mahito avoids again and again being a mere piece of meat for these man-eaters, it also represents the widely accepted churning of the war machine and the very real fear that war might continue and he would bypass a life stage or two by going directly from boy to soldier, another body in the meat grinder.When the boy is offered bricks of stone to make his own world, he sees them as building blocks for tombs, and he rejects them. He conscientiously objects to the cruel world in its current form; he wants blocks of wood to build common houses and constructions. Yet, he is told, the bricks of stone do not have to be used for tombs and to mark the many untimely deaths our reality brings, it could build something entirely different... with a change of mentality and a little imagination.Miyazaki’s likely last film, while pleasing his dedicated earliest audiences now all grown, is truly meant for the upcoming generation. The world with its wars, its pandemics, its technology and disasters is very scary, but it’s not beyond repair. The first step to leading the future is to be brave and prepared to fight in a world we don’t yet understand; to finally see, and accept, the very dark side of this earth and the people on it, before we can envision a solution and see a way out of the despair and darkness.After journeying through a magical world with complex rules and intricacies, and with an enlightenment only gained by intense experience, he is able to return to the real world to continue carrying on bold missions... much like the children conquering and ruling in Narnia returning to Earth with the confidence of kings and queens, to build kingdoms and forge alliances, and ultimately, change the world as we know it."

        "review": "CIFF 2023Film #3“How do you live?”Wouldn’t you know it, the movie with that initial title is about death, how everything has a stopping point, and how that’s okay. One day at a time. This was another experience that I have admittedly had with most Miyazaki movies, where I think it’s pretty damn good, I’m glad I spent my time with it, but I’m not over the moon in love with it as most others. Instead of trying to dissect why that is, I’ve mostly just rolled with the punches with it. Maybe one day I’ll be a fanatic of his. Regardless, man, what a gorgeously animated film this is. During the opening sequence, the protagonist running into wild bursts of fire is presented in a way that reminded me ofThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya, and anything that reminds me of that masterpiece is good in my book. I am very interested with how the films of Miyazaki portray blood, because his movies very rarely use it, but when they do, the people or creatures that bleed do so like it’s ageyserof the stuff. Very visceral, very compelling, one moment of it that made the audience I saw this with loudly gasp (myself included) and another moment involving a pelican that felt like something out of a different, rather scary film. Good stuff! Rest assured, there’s also these little white marshmallow balloon type creatures that are the cutest munchkins I’ve seen, and giant ass parakeets that eat people and I think aremaybesupposed to represent fascists that I also thought were super cute. If there is one routine thing about Miyazaki’s films that I deeply admire, it’s that his movies so often have multiple moments where the space, and the characters that inhabit these different spaces, can breathe. The gorgeous piano music plays, colors overwhelm you, wind howls, what have you. There’s a stillness that evokes a mixture of the beauty of reality while also feeling like it could only come from serene fantasy. I was (maybe foolishly) thinking this was going to end with some magnificent exclaimed point to possibly cap off a decades long career. Instead, this has one of the most low-key ending scenes I’ve seen from a movie in a hot minute, and because of that, I ironically don’t think it’s going to leave my mind anytime soon. Once again, this life is one day at a time. Who will succeed us, how will they live? We can’t know. Still, wedolive.7.5/10"

I was completely spellbound by how its captivating mystery expanded into an untethered, ethereal fantasy. Also, it’s freaky! It’s Miyazaki’s most unsettlingandhilarious movie—those damn birds are a delight.I love it. People are divided on the scattered storytelling; personally, I was completely immersed, lost in the world and the vibes™. The opening isstaggering, haunting the whole movie with quiet melancholy. The ending is beautiful, compounding the movie’s wild ideas into something complete. And the cohesive heart makes up for the loose pieces I didn’t quite get on my first pass (I wanna see it again!).I was deeply moved by its irl reflexivity and even more so by its dense thematic nuances: the closure in accepting our cruel world and in what we leave behind in it. I can’t stop thinking about it and its warawara-shaped charm. It’s a masterwork, or in other words, the latest by Hayao Miyazaki."

        "review": "a striking and strange, sort of elegaic autofiction which warns against pursuing your craft at the expense of all else, perhaps a rumination on its director’s own failure as a mentor. it’s more optimistic than that sounds, but the mournfulness of its opening act stuck with me, especially with the space that feeling is given.as well as the connections to Miyazaki's childhood, the other self-insert is pretty clear: an old craftsman sits on the boundary between the world of the living and the dead, (rather narcissistically) seeking a successor of his own bloodline to continue using basic shapes to carefully build worlds that stretch across time and reality.the subtext of the film has been known for months, years even, but that doesn’t make it any less affecting when you see it illustrated with some of the strangest animation of Miyazaki’s long career - the world warping, bending and breaking under its creator’s burden of knowledge. it’s the most outwardly dreamlike of his films, but grounded by blood and guts and bird shit (that last one is mostly to make a mockery of yet another bumbling Ghibli dad), the crassness and cruelty of the real world intruding upon the picturesque storybook cottages, libraries and mausoleums, all carefully constructed but falling into disrepair. that sense of collapse feels like it’s everywhere - from how the film begins at a languid pace with long, observant cuts of animation before becoming exponentially chaotic as its main character Mahito first catches a glimpse of a world beyond his. Hisaishi, a collaborator of Miyazaki’s for so long that his music has become a key part of the characterisation of his films, takes a more sparse approach, the score cues are more subdued, the room between piano notes is more expansive, as though to let the world being created here speak a little more for itself.in that visual language there’s echoes of past films - Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso, Totoro and The Wind Rises all emerge in particular cuts of animation as well as in the general mood - but it’s far from just playing the hits. an early example emerges in sequence of a fire, where the background smears and consumes its main character Mahito, a moment which will continue to appear to him every time he closes his eyes. the sequence himself feels expressionist in a way which I don’t think I’ve seen from Miyazaki before, the drawings of people taking on a looser and stranger shape than the very strictly codified house style, almost ghoulish in appearance. even at the end of his career there’s something that feels new, rather than stodgily traditional or nostalgic.won’t say everything I feel about it here beyond this breathless nonsense because I have to review it for real, but to the surprise of nobody who knows me, I really liked this."

A bunch of cuties.Miyazaki does it again. Creating some of the finest animation and best world building. Seriously, no one does world building in an animated movie better (but we all knew that), and this film is a testament that Miyazaki’s imagination is a constant powerhouse. The highlight for me was the hand-in-hand nature of the visuals and score, and how that elevated certain moments where there was silence in the world. They simply go together so well. Joe Hisaishi creates a score with a primary focus on the piano, and it’s incredibly beautiful and memorable. One of his best. The visual and score components also create a tone of solemness that is matched by the themes of dealing with grief. I see the whole alternate world as a sort of internal process of working through one’s grief, which (to be as vague as possible) originates from a tragic backstory that the boy hasn’t quite been able to work through. My main (and really only) criticism is that The Boy and the Heron is very plot heavy, which does somewhat take away from the emotional impact that I got from the themes and the boy’s journey. On a positive note, there’s so many interesting details with regard to the rules of the world that this can be somewhat overlooked. A very beautiful film that I hope to revisit.Also, parakeet with a knife. Beware!"

I just think that on first watch, the film feels a bit overstuffed and random at times.But at the same time, I can't help but admire the sheer amount of creativity and passion Miyazaki injects into every frame of his film. I am so glad that Ghibli films look like this again after... you know...Earwig and the Witch. For all the confusion I experience trying to follow the story, it ends on such a satisfying high note that retroactively makes all the random segments less scattered.

It's an allegorical film that ponders mortality and legacy. It celebrates life at its most magical and frightening, yet despite an undercurrent of passing, it is tranquil. As if Miyazaki is telling us that as scary as life may be, you're brave enough to face it. The Boy and the Heron deeply moved me. If this really is Miyazaki's final film, there's no better a parting gift than this. Thank you, Miyazaki-san."

        "review": "Gilles Deleuze se regodeaba en la estructura narrativa y la lógica interna de las breves novelas de Lewis Carroll, y lo hacía consciente de estar dirigiéndose a un espacio no-direccionado, a un portal hacia ningún lugar o, quién sabe, a una habitación completamente blanca. El absurdo, en Carroll, era siempre productivo: quizá por eso sus lógicas guardan un potencial político —por la vía de la imaginación— tan asombroso.En el cine de Miyazaki hay sembradas, aquí y allá, huellas de esa forma de narrar consistente en el continuo reciclaje, en la mudanza. He pensado mucho, a lo largo de esta película, en cómo trabajaban con elloEl castillo ambulanteyEl viaje de Chihiro, quizá las más ambiciosas —hasta ahora— al pensar este mundo de pasadizos sin fin. Pero lo que hace aquí, con la fulgurante energía de un cineasta en plenitud —sabemos que Miyazaki llevaba diez años retirado, pero la película no lo sabe—, está a mi juicio en otro orden distinto de cosas.Si Alicia se deslizaba por el agujero de un árbol y accedía a un universo con unas lógicas completamente distintas al nuestro —es decir, a nuestros parámetros realistas—, el protagonista deThe Boy and the Heronejecuta ese movimiento de forma mucho más progresiva. Lo que más adoro de esa primera media hora de la película es el modo en que el marco costumbrista parece ir descomponiéndose, en base a pequeños gestos extrañantes que ajustan nuestro ojo a lo que está por venir. Existe, no obstante, ese instante-umbral, pero Miyazaki se encarga de afirmar que nuestro propio mundo es también susceptible del hechizo: lo único que pasa es que lo esconde mejor.Lo que viene a partir de ahí es un despliegue arrollador de imaginación, recursos visuales y emoción. Que, justo antes de adentrarse en el bosque, el niño protagonista lea —y llore leyendo—¿Cómo vives?, la novela de Genzaburo Yoshino que se suponía que Miyazaki estaba adaptando —aunque finalmente se relacione con ella oblicuamente, como si fuese un fantasma detrás de todo mecanismo—, marca para mí el espacio central del gran laberinto narrativo que tenemos por delante: tenemos, en primer lugar, la historia de un niño en la rampa de salida hacia la adultez; también la de un niño que ha perdido a su madre y trata de reconciliarse con esa ausencia; por último, la de un niño que ha de hacerse cargo de las fallas sistémicas de una coyuntura política, la suya, en la que la vileza totalitaria se expande con cientos de rostros distintos.Al igual que la novela de Yoshino, y aunque Miyazaki elija desviarse de la vía costumbrista y acceder a este mundo a través del truco, el juego y la invención,The Boy and the Heronfija su mirada sobre la superficie de la solidaridad, de la amistad —con la versión juvenil de tu propia madre, incluso, en un guiño prodigioso a la novela— como potencia comunitaria y reguero de esperanza. El incendio que abre la película no hace más que engrandecer sus ambiciones: en un mundo recorrido por la guerra, las violencias del capital y las ansias de poder, Miyazaki urge a dar la vuelta al tablero. Estas reglas no nos sirven, tendremos que inventar un mundo nuevo y —lo más difícil— tendremos que hacerlo dentro del nuestro. Esa es su forma de utopismo: la del que piensa que en nuestro entorno material están los fundamentos de un mundo distinto, de un mundo imaginario.[aquí el texto que publiqué en Kaminker:kaminker.es/chillando-en-los-pasadizos-de-otro-mundo/]"

Das möchte ich aber ohnehin nicht, denn ich würde euch allen empfehlen völlig ahnungslos in diesen Film zu gehen. Ghibli Fans kommen hier sowieso nicht dran vorbei!Ich sass gestern Abend also im Kino und liess das neuste Werk der Animeschmiede auf mich wirken. Dabei vergoss ich immer ein paar Tränchen, weil ich zu Ghibli von Kindesbeinen an eine tiefe Bindung besitze. So wurde mir gestern schmerzlich bewusst, dass dies hier nun der letzte Film in dieser Art und Weise sein könnte. Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich mag den heutigen Animestil sehr gerne, der kontrastreich, bunt und klar daherkommt. Diese Feinheit in den Hintergründen, diese ruhigen und klangvollen Töne, die etwas älteren Figurendesigns. Das ist jedoch etwas was ich heutzutage dennoch vermisse. Hayao Miyazaki lässt all die nostalgischen Gefühle mit seinem neusten Werk wieder aufkommen. Erneut kreiert er eine fantastische, geheimnisvolle Welt, die vor Kreativität nur so strotzt. Dazu gesellen sich die emotionalen Töne von Joe Hisaishi und der nächste Ghibli Hit ist geboren.Inhaltlich jedoch ist das neuste Werk aus dem Hause Ghibli enorm schwer beladen. Für Kinder denkbar ungeeignet, verarbeitet Miyazaki hier Themen rund um eine perfekte Welt. Aus Spoilergründen möchte ich nicht näher darauf eingehen, jedoch waren die angesprochenen Themen unheimlich spannend, wenngleich manchmal auch schwierig zu entschlüsseln, weil die japanische Mythologie einen nicht unwesentlichen Teil spielt. Hier dürfte sich mir der Film auch erst bei weiteren Sichtungen komplett erschliessen.Audiovisuell istDer Junge und der Reiherein absolutes Meisterwerk, an welchem es nichts zu bemängeln gibt. Nur charaktertechnisch wird es etwas schwierig, denn die Hauptfigur Mahito ist recht unterkühlt in seinem Handeln, was natürlich an seiner Vergangenheit liegt. Dennoch fehlte mir hier letztlich der Zugang nicht nur zu ihm, sondern auch zu allen Nebenfiguren. Erst am Ende hätte mich der Film beinahe emotional erwischt, doch dann lief auch schon der Abspann über die Leinwand. Eine Sache die am Ende etwas enttäuschend war, denn Studio Ghibli, insbesondere Miyazaki, schafft es ansonsten eigentlich immer mir einige Tränen zu entlocken. Dies schaffte das neuste Werk leider nicht ganz. Dennoch, wer sich als Anime Fan diesen Film im Kino entgehen lässt, wird es sein Leben lang bereuen. Dies könnte das Ende der alten Schule darstellen. Ein Film der durch seine Feinheiten und Details zu faszinieren weiss und eine unglaubliche Kreativität an den Tag legt. Solche Filme werden heute eigentlich gar nicht mehr produziert! Und sollte dies nun wirklich das Ende des Grossmeisters darstellen, dann möchte ich mich hier in aller Förmlichkeit bedanken. Vielen Dank an Hayao Miyazaki und seine vielen Filme, die mein Leben so sehr bereichert haben. Vielen Dank an Joe Hisaishi, der diese Filme stets mit den schönsten Klängen dieser Erde unterstützt hat. Und vielen Dank an Studio Ghibli für all diese tollen Produktionen und die vielen Jahre voller Träume und Fantastereien. Ich schulde dieser Traumschmiede mein Leben. ♥️♥️♥️-Ranking 2023"

        "review": "I’ve seen this movie at least ten times in cinemas. I’ve seen it both subtitled and dubbed, in tiny screening rooms with three other people and packed opera houses with a couple thousand. Every time I see it, after Miyazaki suddenly ends the film with one of the most indelible images in his filmography, the crowd almost invariably shuffles out to a sort of unsettled murmuring. Every time I hear people say they need to see it again because it was too much to absorb in one sitting. Personally, I keep seeing it again, and growing to appreciate it more and more. For a filmmaker whose entire career is viewed pretty much in retrospect, it has been fascinating to watch 2023 audiences attempt to dissect a film like The Boy and the Heron: the most formally audacious and conceptually abstract film Miyazaki has ever made, and one that is a capstone to his half a century of contributions to the language of cinema.In 2018, halfway through the drafting process of The Boy and the Heron, Miyazaki’s mentor, the great director Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, The Tale of The Princess Kaguya)passed away. The film reflects this psychological break. Its first half is a Takahata-style naturalist depiction of wartime life in Japan, with clear echoes of Miyazaki’s own childhood. The second half finds Miyazaki grieving yet unencumbered by the weight of Takahata’s expectations, hurtling through his wildest aesthetic ideas with escalating frenzy, as if trying to get out all his thoughts before his time on earth comes to its inevitable close. The beautiful pastoral stillness of the first half provides an ideal contrast to the ecstatic chaos of the second – an all-encompassing journey that is, even by the standards of Miyazaki’s legendary filmography, towering in its ambition.It’s funny that there seem to be about as many people who wish the film were entirely naturalistic as there are people who are who feel it takes too long to get to the fantastical. But this conspicuous schism is a feature, not a bug; it is a deliberate and bold Tarkovsky-esque artistic feat, unlike any you’ll find in the world of commercial feature animation. Who else but Miyazaki could subject you to forty-five minutes of daily life in 1944 Japan  before tossing you into a fantasy adventure loaded with references to all manner of eastern and western art: Böcklin’s “The Isle of Death,” ancient Chinese proverbs (“those who seek my knowledge shall die”), Dante’s Inferno (“Fecemi la divina potestate”), and the Japanese legend of Toyotama-hime and her birthing room. Almost no other filmmaker alive is working at this level.The film is obsessed with, among other things, doubleness. The “world above” and “world below” are mirrors of each other. Mahito’s mother is replaced by his aunt, and their roles and identities intersect throughout. Kiriko exists in two places at once, voiced by the same actor both young and old. Producer Toshio Suzuki hashinted in interviewsthat the heron in the title (who, as it turns out, is also a human) is based on him. Suzuki,in changing the title of the filmupon its release, also gave the film itself two identities: both How Do You Live and The Boy and the Heron. Appropriately, it seems the heron man inserted himself into the title as one final wink to the audience.The enigmatic Tower Master, who appears in the second half as a genial uncle and a God-like despot, seems to be based on Takahata. The parakeets, having evolved in the world of his creation, are the hubristic human-like characters intent on arriving at self-determination after existing under his rule. The more I watch the film, the more affection I feel for these oafish birds who are (like us) so fixated on food and consumption that they don’t appreciate the beauty that surrounds them constantly. In Mahito’s ultimate rejection of the Tower Master’s power, we see Miyazaki resetting the dynamic he developed with his late mentor, and offering the hope that future generations can live their lives with more purpose, even in a world of “rampant murder and thievery” that will “soon be consumed by flames.”Hisaishi’s score is stripped down but purely cinematic. His icy strings evoke the morning dew, the sudden piano strikes that recall a heron striding across a placid lake, the playful plucking that reflects the synchronized movements of parakeets. The centerpiece track and main theme of the film, “Ask Me Why,” plays at three specific key moments throughout. It’s a solo piano track performed by Hisaishi himself, written for Miyazakias a birthday gift, and repurposed into a film that itself represents a kind of rebirth. The music is in intimate conversation with Miyazaki’s imagery, which is itself in intimate conversation with us as the audience. It is Hisaishi at his least bombastic and I’ve come to recognize that it stands by The Tale of The Princess Kaguya as one of his very best scores for the studio.Despite the reporting that Miyazaki is still at work, the fact that the studio moved heaven and earth to recruit adequate talent (starting with Honda but including Ohira, Yonebayashi, Ando, Yamashita etc) to deliver this film 8 years after the studio officially went on hiatus (and the fact that it is reportedlythe most expensive Japanese production of all time) demonstrates how difficult it would be for Miyazaki to deliver another feature. The literal self-destruction that concludes the film feels like an ending as definitive as anyone could possibly imagine. But of course Miyazaki’s imagination extends further than most of us can even conceive."

        "review": "This is not for little kids. Viewer discretion is advised.Frustratingly all over the place thematically, tonally, and narratively, and it doesn’t make much sense on an emotional level either. The textbook definition of “The whole is less than the sum of its parts”, and just like a lot of his previous works, the film endsveryabruptly. It feels as if there are 3 separate movies crammed into one, and none of it feels entirely satisfying.That said, when it comes to creating the sense of wonder, the man’s still got it. In a way,How Do You Live?feels like the greatest hits of everything this master filmmaker has done in the last 40+ years of his career, and then some. Some of it works, others make me want to watch his previous films instead. You will experience all the best and worst tendencies of Miyazaki as a storyteller, and that might just be enough for most people.More thoughts to come after I see it for the second time next week.UPDATE:I saw it again"

You’ve seen my profile picture, so you know it’s heavy when I say this is his most emotional, most complex, most reflective, most vivid work yet and I don’t think it’s really possible to process everything without repeat viewings. But the statements being made on loss and grief rung truer than I was prepared for. Staggering. We really are blessed. Can only imagine how cathartic this was for Miyazaki to make & in my eyes, our greatest living filmmaker has one more masterpiece under his belt"

        "review": "A lone man waits at the edge of the universe, greyed and tired, desperately stacking blocks to keep the world upright. He searches for a successor but none arrive, and those who do, decide that it's not their destiny. It's hard not to read into that scene as Miyazaki's ante mortem to his career and to the artistry that exists in connection with his filmography and that of Studio Ghibli. He's old, he's tired, he can't go on much longer, but if it's to hold the world up for another day, then he'll go — because he's the only man who can. A wave of nostalgia blows over me from the first frame of Miyazaki's The Boy and the Heron. It's a reminder of a time past, a style of animation that's stuck — imperfect, and all the better for it. There's grit and gumption built into every celluloid, the heart of the artist is felt. What a feeling to receive from a film — and how sad to know of its inevitable passing. Adorned with a pensive and graceful tone, The Boy and the Heron achieves the unachievable and summarises an entire career, but fittingly, only through spiritually tandem visuals. From Spirited Away to Grave of the Fireflies and back to The Wind Rises, like an iridescent kaleidoscope, every film recontextualises every moment, and every moment recontextualises an oeuvre. It's hard not to wax nostalgia for a Miyazaki film in 2023, especially one as romantically-tinged and fond of the old as this one. It's a funeral; an ode — a farewell. Miyazaki extends his grief to that of Japan and the heavy spectre that continues to burden it long past its post-war loss and humiliation. Mahito lost his mother in the war, but he lost more than that. He lost his motherland with it. How can something so huge and momentous be overcome? How do we grief? How do we live? But it does, and we do. We are born. We live. We suffer. We die. The world moves on. First, with us. Then briefly, for us. And finally, without us. Miyazaki, rest easy, we will be okay."

I can’t say it better than he did, but I can heavily paraphrase.“We are so lucky to be living in the world when Mozart is composing his symphonies. When van Gogh is painting his masterpieces. Because Miyazaki is just as much of a master of his craft. He understands that there is no beauty without horror, no joy without darkness, no innocence without corruption. These films are so personal to the point where the experience of watching them is like having a conversation with Miyazaki himself. He is, in my mind, the greatest animated film director of all time.So forgive me if this isn’t very Canadian, but howfuckinglucky are we?!”p.s. john tory sat right behind me hahahaha"

        "review": "When you set out to make a final work, it always goes differently. What comes up first is the turmoil of making anything. The process is hard and making the final statement must be the hardest one of all. You can imagine the spiritual relief of finishing not just a work of art but the final one. The last statement. A swan song to a principled filmography of your own design. This final movie, by the necessity of self-reflection, must then reflect a lifetime of work. It is a last signal to the workers who help accomplish the vision. We are putting all of our chips on the table and there are no mulligans. This is it.Such weight surrounds the making of The Boy and the Heron, the last — but probably not final — film by Studio Ghibli chief architect Hayao Miyazaki. This is a gift to the world, a conclusive transmission from artist to audience that says, here is what I have learned and know about life and want to teach you and show you about life.This is a study of how to live, previously more appropriately titled How Do You Live?, that title reflects in a real way what the movie is asking the audience. How do you live? An open-ended philosophical question to which the film provides some answers but no solutions. You live by being and by doing, by being a part of something bigger than yourself, by the connections you have made, and by what you leave behind.What Hayao Miyazaki has left behind — whether or not there is another movie, this will be the late-era movie that is looked at to explore his filmography — is an entire world of cinema unto itself. This critic remembers the total shift in life experience (experience, not just in moviegoing) that accompanied my first theatrical exploration (exploration, not just watching a movie) that came with watching Spirited Away (2001).The way that went is that I was transformed, in precise and equal ways, just as the character of the movie was transformed. I’m not sure I have seen another animated movie that gave me an equal spiritual journey until now. We talk about movies we love as shifting who we are, as vessels of storytelling that we then must carry with us, as defining facets of our new personality. How there is the us that exists before the movie and the us we walk out of the movie being.That’s what The Boy and the Heron feels like, a transformative stage of life that we must experience on its own terms, as our conceptions about movies erode and we allow the movie to lay down a new path. The best animated cinema is one such pathway of imagination and human experience and the best practitioners of the format understand the gravity (and ungravity) of working in such a fluid, dynamic fashion.The dynamic is altered when Hayao Miyazaki approaches cinema as a wisened Octogenarian and tells us what he knows. You can no longer confuse animation as a toy or a corporate vehicle for on-brand messaging. Because here the animation can expand to any wider definition of what cinema can be, as animation as a medium is given a new lease on life by the sensation of the end closing in.The Boy and the Heron takes its time. It is a slower cinema. We establish spaces and places and the characters in them must also be established not just through the lens of expert animated storytellers but through the history of Japan and its movies. There is the same tender cultural richness at its heart, a love for life, and joy in its discoveries, that uplift the spirit and allow new dimensions to be explored, without ever just being a movie about new dimensions.Studio Ghibli will often use nature and grotesque creations to create lasting, memorable character moments. They have applied this approach with the Heron, who is an old man trapped inside a bird, and through the use of frenzied parakeets who serve as such gorgeously illustrated villains, these birds are both some of our finest cinematic creations.The story is about a young boy called Mohito (Mahito Maki), who explores a land shared by the living and the dead. Here, Hayao Miyazaki self-inserts: he uses his own character and vision of the world to explore how the end is the start of something new. Death is the start of being dead. The end of life is exploring, for the first time, what the end is like. How we live in the meantime determines how we will experience the end and what we have the capacity to see.Monumental symbolism lines the frames of The Boy and the Heron. We feel inside its cells, the journey of Hayao Miyazaki through life and through cinema. This is an autobiography ingeniously made in a different model and it can only be an animated film. There is no other way to accomplish what is accomplished here. Only in the stories of Studio Ghibli. Our presentation was of the original Japanese language version but a starry cast, as expected from the studio, highlights the forthcoming translated version. Whichever you see, just be sure to see it.This is the start of the end. As such, it feels like a new beginning. The movies will always be with us. Now we have another key text to absorb and understand them in a new way. Whether we get another film from Hayao Miyazaki is almost beside the point. In the meantime, we just have to think about how we live. Good news for us is we have a guidebook for how one of cinema’s most venerated workers sees life. And now we will see life differently, too.Read the review on The Twin Geeks"

        "review": "In his most personal endeavor and imaginative creation, Hayao Miyazaki invites audiences to witness the captivating world ofThe Boy and the Heron, a cinematic tapestry woven from the rich legacy of his six decades as an artist.Mahito (Soma Santoki) serves as Miyazaki's alter ego, shaped by the aftermath of World War II, mourning for his mother, and his distant father, a director in the airplane industry. Mahito's venture into fantasy becomes an escape from harsh realities, a quest for purpose amid life's trials. The film pays homage to Genzaburo Yoshino's novel \"君たちはどう生きるか\" (How do you live?), inspiring Miyazaki in his youth, exploring profound questions about life's meaning and individual roles in society. Through Mahito's journey, the film prompts viewers to reflect on existential queries amid fantastical challenges.The heron (Masaki Suda) symbolizes freedom, wisdom, and peace, guiding Mahito through a transformative journey to uncover the beauty of nature while facing its perils. Acting as a bridge between dreams and reality, the heron advocates for nature preservation. Mahito's encounters with fantastical creatures lead to his evolution, emphasizing his role in the cyclical dance of life and death represented by the enigmatic \"warawara,\" highlighting the interrelation of all living things.Yet, at its core,The Boy and the Heroncelebrates art and creativity as tools for expression, communication, liberation, and transformation. Mahito, an artist, uses various mediums to convey emotions, ideas, hopes, and fears, finding escape from the oppressive reality. In the realm of creativity, he explores grief, forging connections with fantastical creatures or symbolic representations. His artistic canvas becomes a space to transcend tangible constraints, navigating sorrow through imagination and connecting with kindred spirits.The film poses a captivating question: Is Mahito genuinely embarking on a fantastical journey in a world teeming with colossal birds, all in pursuit of his new mother, Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura)? Alternatively, are we glimpsing the musings of a young boy who employs his imagination to reconcile with fate, releasing the profound grief that shackles him and embracing the woman destined to be his new mother? The more one contemplates, the more apparent it becomes thatThe Boy and the Heronis meticulously crafted as a dream—a sequence of disjointed events populated by peculiar beings. In this dreamlike narrative, our protagonist discovers facets of himself, ultimately regaining control and steering his own destiny.The Boy and the Heronshowcases Miyazaki's storytelling mastery, providing a visually and emotionally rich experience that prompts introspection and resonates with the audience's self-discovery journey. It makes you hope Miyazaki never retires, wishing for his timeless work to endure.Hayao Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli|My Favorite Movies of the 2020s"

There wasn’t really much detail other than the sheer ambiguity of the project. The rep asked the audience not to share the full details of the plot. However, sharing the experience is greatly appreciated. And even before the screening started, there was an uncertainty about Hayao Miyazaki’s fate as a filmmaker. It’s been debunked by Studio Ghibli that Miyazaki is not retiring. He has more stories to tell…As for this film,The Boy and The Heronis a combination of Miyazaki’s classical style of storytelling. Personified animals, demons, angels, fantastical worlds open Mahito’s mind. Mahito is being tested by his determination to find the truth about his life.How Do You Live?is the original title of the film and it fits perfectly with the narrative here. Mahito questions his morality and his purpose in the life he has liven over the years. Tragedy strikes in the beginning but, there’s more to Mahito‘s life that I can’t really reveal.At the end of the day,The Boy and The Heronis an absolute gorgeous film that will be debated around anime/Studio Ghibli fans from around the world. The joy of being at TIFF is the audience and the passion behind Miyazaki’s vision. This is definitely a winner for the People’s Choice Award. And certainly, this is my favorite animated film of the year. Sorry to all theSpiderversefans out there!"

        "review": "Miami GEMS Film Festival (Film #1):The Boy & The Heron features yet another showcase of a master storyteller’s cinematic prowess firing on all cylinders to craft a movie filled with all the magic and wonder that is usually found in all of the best Studio Ghibli fare.One of the biggest standout elements of the entire film for me would definitely have to be the screenplay. With this film, writer Hayao Miyazaki (also director) delivers yet another unforgettable story that is packed with every ounce of thematic depth that you would normally expect from his work. In this case, it is a captivating storyline about a teenage boy named Mahito (played by Soma Santoki) whose mother dies in a war and has to live with a new surrogate mother who looks EXACTLY like his previous one (played by Yoshino Kimura), thus finding himself coping with his loss and being thrusted into a fantasy world that leads him to a path of self-reflection and enthralling adventure. At its core, it is an extraordinary tale that is about grappling with grief and changes that arise in everyday life, but in the long run it leaves the viewer with a heartfelt, beautifully communicated message about growing up, learning to accept everything around you, and gaining the ability to overcome trauma. Every one of these themes is explored in manners that are consistently concrete while also delivering on providing a simultaneously fun and cathartic journey for Mahito that results in a strongly realized character arc to go along with the aforementioned message, which is one that i think has the power to resonate with a lot of people. In general, this is a film that provides further proof that Miyazaki has not lost his touch as a director.But not only is his writing a strong asset of the film, but his directing also soars in an endless manner the whole way through. For one thing, his eye for elaborate world building is still intact here and is filled with all the visual splendor and imaginative potency that has been present in some of his previous films (particularly Spirited Away). It also helps that the scope and scale for this film is uniformly grand for the entire runtime (backed up with great cinematography work with Atsushi Okui) and made for plenty of instances where i was in constant awe towards how the world of the film is presented. Whether it is through the use of sweeping camerawork, multiple uses of imposing wide shots, or the precise editing style that is utilized, Miyazaki immerses you into an astonishingly beautiful and wondrous world that you want to live in. However, there are moments in which Miyazaki does allow for his characters to breathe and convey what they are thinking without using any words (and are driven by the musical score and sound) that i found to be brilliantly executed because of how much he clearly cares about making these occasions mean something in the long run while using the visual medium of filmmaking to tell a story. As a whole, Miyazaki’s directorial flair once again shines throughout this entire film, which is one that I thought illustrated his expertise in this department in the same way his best films do.The next standout aspect of the film is the voice cast, who all deliver superb work regardless of how much screen time they have on their belt. For starters, Soma Santoki gives a rock solid vocal performance as Mahito; one that captures the feelings of being agitated towards the world around him before developing into a person who learns how to value life itself, which has a ton to live for. There is also Masaki Suda as the titular Grey Heron, who gives a strong turn that brings a ton of delightfully snarky comic relief into the mix. There are other vocal performances in this film from the likes of Shōhei Hindo, Ko Shibasaki, and Kaoru Kobayashi (amongst many that are too much to name) whose characters are not around for much of the movie, but they still manage to deliver memorable turns that make the most out of their limited screen time. In a general fashion, the cast for this film bring strong performances to the table that bring a lot to the characters they are portraying and makes them as memorable as possible.Finally, i have to say that i was immensely impressed by each of the technical aspects of the entire film. It goes without saying that the animation for this film is spectacular and reminded me a lot of how beautiful 2D/hand drawn animation can be. Every single ounce of gorgeous color, the excellent character designs, and intricate art direction make the world of the film come to life and present it in as vibrant of a fashion as possible. The editing by Takeshi Seyama is amazing work that contains a ton of precision that helps in making every scene of the film play out exactly how they should without the need for them to overstay their welcome. It also results in a film with superb pacing that contains the perfect mix between fun, engrossing scenes (particularly the action scenes) and slower, quieter moments that allow the viewer to connect with the characters. The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is top-tier work once again and added many layers of emotional depth to many scenes through its tender (though never corny) approach. Lastly, the sound design for this film is magnificent work the whole way through that not only sounds clear & crisp, but also lured me into the world of the film at multiple instances because of how effectively it was used.All in all, The Boy & The Heron is yet another gigantic winner from a well-regarded, iconic director whose work has stood the test of time throughout the years and i feel like this is yet another one that i do think will go on to receive that status."

It has a new set of adorable little beings that give the soot sprites a run for their money. I want a Warawara plushie asap. Actually, make it twenty.I am beyond satisfied, and so glad to have been able to experience Miyazaki’s return to the silver screen on such an occasion. This is what VIFF is all about."

        "review": "Miyazki returns with a world as gorgeously rendered as it is hopelessly meandering and hermetic, something like the spirit world ofSpirited Awayas reimagined via Tarkovsky (and taken over by birds). With that earlier film, it felt like every one of Chihiro’s steps was discovering some new corner or facet of a landscape that always felt organically coherent; here, on the other hand, Mahito’s journey to the other side feels a bit like it’s just being made up as it goes along. Which is fine, as far as Murakami-like drift goes, but it was just difficult for me to care very much about a swashbuckling proctress who suddenly appears with no coherent relation to whomever had come along before or after her. And far be it from me to answer the question “how do you live?” for anyone else but me, but the answers at the end of it all seemed fairly trite given all the effort it took to arrive there."

        "review": "“I can’t believe I’m this lucky to see it.”“Dude, Spirited Away is his best why say Ponyo?”“How many tickets do you think they’ll have left for us? 20? 30?”Many conversations were brewing outside the theater line; stretching almost towards the next block. Some were eagerly texting their friends in terms of bragging rights. Some who hadn’t seen any of promos were speculating on what the work would even be about. Some had camped outside with lawn chairs hoping that they could get a chance to even see it. Times like these remind me how much a director like Miyazaki has earned this much recognition; just on name alone.Of course, bringing up the name brings upon feelings of comfort and connection.Spirited Away, Howls Moving Castle,My Neighbor Totoro;movies many have grown up on. Miyazaki conjurors up relatability without sacrificing artistic integrity. Characters who are wisked way into certain situations, an escape but also an opportunity to grow. However, these stories of escape often have a reflectiveness to it coming from the man himself. Ironic enough, stories of magical sorcerers or cuddly forest creatures come from a man fed up and angry. He’s a grumpy grandpa but yet sees the beauty of the world he’s forced to live in.I stress enough that I find Miyazaki to be one of the most intimate filmmakers I’ve ever come across. Every movie of his feels like a conversation or a story about his feelings. His opinions never feel overbearing or preachy, but real. It comes from a man who’s trying to search for meanings of his existence. The aforementioned movies listed above have captivated audiences for these reasons I’ve mentioned.But has he grows older, I think Miyazaki realizes the fans and the people who’ve looked up or are and were close to him will outlast him. “Grandpas moving onto next world soon but he is leaving behind this film” was his mission statement for the 6 year long project. For people who’ve grown up with his films, for newcomers, and for the people who will come across it.The Boy and the Heron(god the Japanese title is better) is ultimately coming from a wise old man who’s experienced the world back and forth. From a person who’s made mistakes and gone through hardship.It’s unlike any film Miyazaki ever made up to this point; not just a matter of saying “oh it’s like x movie that he created.” It’s more like elements, resembling shots, and themes from his past works such as coming of age, fascism, and nature (ones that heavily came to mind were Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Kiki). It’s ultimately his most intimate, abstract, and personal in that case, a wrap up and look back and everything that’s come before. It’s world, much like our own, is under this umbrella of death, a gothic nature over our characters in which the past themes can interact in (literal and metaphorical).At the same time, it’s self reflective. As it is like a world like our own, minus fantastical elements, it reminds the audience of the perils of life; the good and the bad. The ultimate goal here of the film is the passing down of knowledge from a man who’s experienced life his own way. A mediation but a call to action. One of Miyazakis most humanistic but one of his most spiritual at the same time in terms of growth. You may forget the exact story, but the feeling and meaning from it sticks with you.As my theater crowed in to watch another movie from the filmmaker they’ve related and learned so much from, the searching for existence that Miyazaki gleamed from is self reflected back the audience that watch his films. The statement that same audience will cry tears and share interpretations of once the work is over. The Heron states to forget the story, but the feeling and question will stick in our minds.How do you live?"

        "review": "Miyazaki joins accomplished filmmakers such as Wes Anderson, Scorsese, Spielberg, Fincher, and Nolan who, in their late-career phases, have made some of their most ambitious and/or self-reflective works in the 2020s. I will try to avoid specifics, but I will say that this film is one of Miyazaki’s most imaginative and wondrous worlds he’s ever created, and the animation has never looked better. There’s never not something to be in awe of - the composition of each frame and how characters move within them, the colors, the dreamscapes, the character and creature designs - it’s truly unbelievable.About an hour into it I was just taking in all of the world-building and spellbinding visuals, then I started to get preoccupied with trying to pinpoint what the film was going for exactly, then I tried to shake that off and I just sat back and went along for the ride until towards the end, everything came together. It’s a lot to take in on one viewing, so I’m going to wait until I watch it again to assess just how much I love it, but as of now, I think it’s pretty great. It’s a film that looks into the future and past at the same time, asking us directly, “how do you go on living after a life-changing loss?” and “once the road ends, how do you come to terms with the life you’ve lived, soon to be left behind?” while also showcasing the transformative ability and escape of art. Who knows if this will be Miyazaki’s last, but if it is, it’s a fitting farewell."

I didn't get the story but I still remember the feeling of impressed and it was unlike anything I've ever watched. Then, I started to high school and watched Spirited Away, naturally lost my shit. Falled in love. Then, three years ago, in COVID the all the lockdown process I decided to watch every Miyazaki film and then directly he became one of my favorite directors of all time. There isn't literally even a film from him that I didn't love.After 10 years, the maestro returned with a new film. I'm waiting this since the first announcement, back then the title was 'How Do You Live?' Unlike his films, Miyazaki is pessimist about people and future. If you closer look on his films, you can see that. He can't stand people. You can see his rage in Nausicaa, you can see his disgust in Spirited Away, the obvious signs had in his last film The Wind Rises. However, The Boy and the Heron is accumulation of maestro' life and work. He has pessimistic and hope about people. The Wind Rises felt like overwhelmingly sad farewell to me. The Boy and the Heron made me cried but smile at the end.Some people reflected this film as Miyazaki' Grave of Fireflies. It's not even close... Miyazaki giving us a epic and emotional ending. A goodbye to his adorable characters and world. There is no other director more accessible (toddler to elder), universal (all around the world) and timeless (the last example of hand-drawing style) than Miyazaki.We are so lucky to be alive at the same time as Hayao Miyazaki and watch this film in theaters. Go see it in theaters while you can. The wind is rising, we must try to live!Subete to arigatou gozaimasu Miyazaki-san.Ranked: MaestroBest Films of 2023"

        "review": "I was lucky enough to be get to see this at a movie theater in Japan, and made sure to go in blind as Studio Ghibli intended. It was pretty easy, as the film is getting released with little publicity or promotion; even something trivial likepromotional pamphletsaren't being sold until after the film's release date.But I do wonder if building an air of mystery and anticipation around this film was the right idea. Going off the reception onEiga.comand <a href=\"https://movies.yahoo.co.jp/movie/386117/\"Yahoo Movies, it's proving to be another divisive film among Japanese audiences, in the same was asPonyoandHow's Moving Castle. The ratings heavily polarized between 1/5 and 5/5 on both sites; Japanese reviewers aren't immune to rating a film 1 star solely on Cinemasins-level nitpicks, but many found the homages to Miyazaki’s earlier films to self-indulgent, others found the visuals unmemorable, and still others had trouble with the film’s pace and confused by the story.I’d say I’m in the third camp. I had trouble getting engrossed in it, and  message Miyazaki wanted to say. For better or worse, it felt like Miyazaki tried to build a narrative based off the contents of his dream journal. The film is bound to a logic that only makes sense within the confines of a dream, bouncing from place to place. And as is common with how we dream at night, it shifts into nightmare on a dime -- there's one suddenly gruesome scene where the protagonist Mahito guts a fish, and he spends most of the film in a world filled with the souls of the dead as well as giant man-eating parakeets(it makes sense in context... kinda).The film is gorgeous though and that alone is worth the price of admission, with the visuals still the top-notch work we come to expect from Studio Ghibli. It does have a look and vibe that feels like an amalgamation of all of Miyazaki's other work; Mahito looks a hell of a lot like Prince Ashitaka fromPrincess Mononoke, there's a gaggle of elderly women who look like the one fromSpirited Away, a fantasy world with stone towers that remind the viewer ofCastle in the Sky, while the outside \"real\" world is the same WW2-era Japan asThe Wind Rises. I didn't find all the homages to be self-indulgent, but they were distracting. It felt overall like the film didn't really have something novel visually to make it stand out from the rest of Miyazaki's work. I guess the titular heron and the parakeets kinda count.When I came out of the theater, I got the same feeling I get whenever a musical artist releases a new album for the first time in decades. In particular, this reminded me of Devo's album Something for Everybody from 2010. It wasn't a bad album by any means, and every track felt like classic Devo, but years on I couldn't tell you the same of a single song from it.The Wind Risesfelt like the perfect capstone to Miyazaki's career, it's my favorite probably because of how he stepped out of his typical settings to tell a story without any fantastical elements. Going back to fantasy for what's (probably) his final film feels like a step backward.So I didn't hate this at all, but I can't say I really liked it either. FWIW I saw this in the theater with a big Miyazaki fan who loved it, so I think hardcore Miyazaki fans across the world will be pretty satisfied overall. The guy has made a lot of films that I love, but when it comes to Ghibli it's Isao Takahata and Yoshifumi Kondo's work that have resonated with me more .I haven't read this film's namesakeHow Do You Live(the English-language change toThe Boy and the Heronis a baffling, awful choice), but at a glance at the synopsis I'd like to see what Miyazaki might have done with a straightforward adaptation of it instead.Hayao Miyazaki ranked"

It's both the melancholic elegy of an aging master and shimmering children's fable, meditating on death, life and art, and like The Fabelmans, how they intermix.I'll speak nothing of the story ~~ go in blind ~~ but through an adventure that's both humble and epic, full of wonder and horror (it's Miyazaki's most grim, brutal movie since Princess Mononoke) the gamut of classic Ghibli themes emerge, a summation and deepening of what came before; the temptation of violence, the joy of creation, salvation through friendship, the unwavering importance of small things, cleansing through love and nature, and our self-destructive march towards apocalypse.It's Miyazaki's most demanding and achingly personal film, with an opaque and slippery plot beholden to no logic but its own. It's another masterpiece."

Second go around I think the pacing is fascinating, especially with Miyazaki’s timing on when to turn the dial into fantasy. This allows us to emotionally connect with our protagonist before major plot events start happening. It’s quite clear that the main character is a director stand-in, judging from when this film is set and the WW2 context we are plunged into. So I really understand his soft spokeness and observant approach to the world. So many callbacks to older Miyazaki work in tone and character, and feels like a balanced medium point betweenSpirited AwayandThe Wind Rises.This will be the last time I catch it before catching it with English subtitles (hopefully soon!). But these watches have definitely been an absolute highlight of my time in Japan so far. Also congratulations to my former employer GKIDS for acquiring the North American rights for the film!! All fingers crossed for that Oscar win!"

        "review": "\"How Do You Live?\" is supposedly Miyazaki's last movie to be directed, the end of an era (the only era so far) for Ghibli Studios. And this film works its hardest to make this the fitting send off it ought to be.The film feels like much of a return to form looking back at the giants of Ghibli in Totoro and Spirited Away, taking both the quaint Japanese countryside of Totoro in the first third of the movie and mixing it with the fantasy world of Spirited Away in the rest. There's also lots of references and inspirations from all the other Ghibli films as well, as a true look back to the end of an era.It doesn't surprise me that Miyazaki chose to adapt a story of \"letting go\" in this film, seeing as I'm sure he thinks people will lose trust in Ghibli once he's gone just because it doesn't have his name on it. He places the viewer in the eyes of Mahito, who is obsessed with the loss of his mother, and can't accept his new stepmother as a result. Miyazaki is no doubt that mother, and I think he hopes we too grow and come to accept someday everyone has to stop, including him, but there are those who are deserving to pass the torch to.If you like the biggest classic Ghibli films you'll enjoy this a lot, as it's very much like them visually and story wise. It's not the most original Ghibli film ever, but it's not supposed to be, so I think people who go in with such expectations will find themselves disappointed.Being in a full theater in Shinjuku not even at primetime was a great sight. It made me feel like the theater is really back, and I hope it's back for good. Goodbye Miyazaki, and rest well."

        "review": "How do you live when someone close to you dies? How do you live when the world is so wicked? How do you live when you feel that you have transgressed, that you, too, are already cursed?In Miyazaki's previous film, he told us -- by way of quoting Paul Valéry -- that we must try to live. But, as suggested by the melancholy that such a statement was dripping with from the start, he knows as well as anybody that it isn't that easy. It's what he's spent potentially his entire career grappling with, this push and pull between the desire to portray optimism in his art while finding it difficult to see past the darkness of this cursed world. In Miyazaki's old age, it seems like both sides of the scale are piling up, lending a sort of frantic freedom to the current era of his filmmaking. He's as desperate as ever to tell us -- the younger generations, for whom it may not be too late -- to build a better world than the one we inherited, to keep living despite all of the uncertainty. And yet, he sees the spiraling of everything around him and understands that it could all go away tomorrow, whether he leaves this earth or it leaves him, pushed past some tipping point we don't yet see.Or something like that.It's strange to watch a Miyazaki movie without the context of it already being a well-established component of his filmography. I suppose that was the case for The Wind Rises, but it was almost half my life ago that I watched that for the first time. And I guess what makes it strange is that every Miyazaki movie has undoubtedly brought something new to the table, and he is a filmmaker who is constantly evolving, yet for most of his filmography I take it for granted that those movies exist as they are. They feel like they've always been here in a timeless sort of way. There's a lot to The Boy and the Heron (as I will begrudgingly call it) that feels novel for Miyazaki: It's more surreal and disjointed than ever, there are stylistic decisions made with the animation that Miyazaki has never accessed before (perhaps influenced by the animation direction of Takeshi Honda?), even Joe Hisaishi's gorgeous, haunting score feels nothing like any of his other Ghibli work, instead recalling his early minimalism while occasionally making way for sweeping, overtly emotional, even somewhat cacophonous swells of sound. Sometimes the dialogue disappears and only the sound effects -- rustling, steps, etc -- remain while the music overtakes the scene. In those moments, I can only be grateful that such perfect imperfection can exist in a movie like this. Ghibli's digital-era shininess is challenged through newfound fluidity, and the sound does just what it needs to do, not necessarily what it's expected to do.For all that is new, you can draw threads from The Boy and the Heron to many of his other films: Much like in Spirited Away, a child is thrust into a fantastical world with the intent of saving their parent(s), meeting a broad cast of characters along the way. Tonally it might be more comparable to Howl's Moving Castle, though perhaps more surreal, and paradoxically more coherent. Thematically, it feels like the natural continuation of The Wind Rises, as Miyazaki's autobiographical musings are far more at the forefront than in his earlier films, which leads to a certain darkness and maturity that carry through the entirety of the film. I wouldn't consider this a downer of a movie, though. Certainly it has plenty of humor to offset that, which again seems in line with Spirited Away (I'm reminded of the bird carrying the baby-turned-mouse in that film, an image that always makes me laugh). But there's also a certain unavoidable emptiness and desperation that can't completely be outweighed by silly creatures and visual gags. The tone is set early on with visions of trauma and a blunt act of self-harm, and even when it strays from that baseline it doesn't take long to remind you where it all started, and where it all must be going. You want catharsis, but how possible is that with the hand that's been dealt? Do you need a tectonic shift, or can you be content with accepting the trajectory of life as it always was?The movie leaves us with some uncertainty, but how can it not when its title asks such a daunting question? \"How Do You Live?\" or, asKaori Shoji of Nikkei Asianotes might capture the essence better than the literal translation: \"How would you choose to live your life?\" The book that the title comes from is only offered a brief reference, maybe a few seconds onscreen, a fleeting hint of the book's spirit haunting the film. I suspect that this movie had its roots in a more straightforward adaptation, but somewhere along the way Miyazaki couldn't help but remix it with autobiography and outlandish fantasy, pushing the original book deeper into the subtext, turning it into less of a source material and more a guiding philosophy.Hayao Miyazaki continues to evolve as a filmmaker, and it’s admirable that, even when he seems to be retreading elements of past work, he never stays in quite the same place. With The Boy and the Heron, he continues an era of introspection that kicked into high gear with The Wind Rises a decade prior. He has always generously infused each of his films with himself (any number of mother characters in his filmography are based on his own), but this has only become more true in this late stage of his career, making him seem increasingly unafraid of how his own flaws might clash with the story he is trying to tell. He’s making movies as if any one of them could be his last, and each plays like an open wound, exploring his guilt, his fears, his love.I find it interesting that Hayao Miyazaki's mother died when she was in her 70s and he was over 40 -- not old, but not the child this film portrays. She had tuberculosis for the bulk of his childhood, though, so maybe the distinction doesn't matter. Absence is a sort of death, whether physically separated or sick behind a door. I also wonder, speaking as someone hasn't experienced it, whether losing a parent would make anyone feel like a child again regardless of how old they are, if the loss of a parent today feels like a loss for the child of the past, no matter how long gone that child is. Maybe it feels like the death of childhood itself which, of course, means the end of everything if you're a child."

Womöglich lag es etwas an der Erwartungshaltung.Von der Inszenierung her ist auch der neue Gibli wiederum unantastbar. Die Kreativität lebt. Leider haben mich die Story und Hauptcharakter Mahito überraschend wenig berührt. Das liegt zum einen an der etwas abstrakten Erzählweise zum anderen am gemächlichen Tempo. Nicht immer habe ich verstanden was gerade abgeht, der japanische O-Ton geizt zudem mit Details.Dafür waren dann die letzten 20 Minuten fast schon etwas gehetzt, das Finale aber sehr stimmig.

        "review": "I’ll admit I found it difficult to get into this one, to shake off the apprehension of watching what might (again) be the last film from a filmmaker I consider a favourite — maybethefavourite. Hardly needs noting that the animation is as stunning as ever, and actually more willing to experiment than before. But while Hisaishi’s scores have reliably been the other key dependable component of Miyazaki’s films, the stripped-back obviousness of this one’s main theme had me feeling almost embarrassed at first — possibly just for how much it sounded like my teenage self absent-mindedly trying to work out a pop song on the piano, which I suppose is meant to be it’s crude charm. But the film (and maybe now even its score) slowly won me over with its adorable yet-to-be-born souls and its cheerfully murderous parakeets and its sentient stone (would be fascinated to know whether Miyazaki has encountered the work of Nigel Kneale) and above all its refusal to skirt around the difficult implications of the material. Miyazaki’s oeuvre is full of complicated children, but still wasn’t prepared for the early moment in which Mahito bashes himself in the head with a rock — obviously shocking for its violence, but also for how honestly it depicts teenage self-harm. At first it seems this head wound will “explain” the subsequent fantasy, just as the injury Dorothy sustains in the twister explains Oz. But I’m not sure the fantasy cant be bracketed off as neatly as in Totoro or Spirited Away; it’s not all that interested in sustaining that dream-reality binary. There are, as always, lessons for us to glean from our protagonist’s journey of self-discovery, but this is also Miyazaki grappling with his life’s work, the legacy he will leave behind, and his relationship with us, his audience."

It’s got bomb imagery galore, classic fairy tale allusions at every corner as well as an army of Nazi Parakeets. However… we seem to hop from one weird thing to another before any emotional stake can be planted, largely blunting the impact of its central story and thereby leaving its weepy moments rather stale.

But these escapes become unpredictable and as difficult to control as the world outside, before long falling into a murky nightmare run by carnivorous bird people… well that last part is more specific to this story but you get the picture.Miyazaki has so many motifs that have come come to define his films: nature, dreamworlds, airplanes… This one remixes all of these ideas into one potent (almost autobiographical) portrait of boy dealing with the chaos of a world on fire. It has the war time whispers of Barefoot Gen and his own The Wind Rises combined with the woozy spirit worlds of Spirited Away. But the thing that really makes this special is that Miyazaki has never captured dream logic quite like he does here. The strange details and milky rhythms are amplified by elliptical logic. Things happen that wouldn’t make sense sense in reality but in a dream everything is perfectly normal. The only other filmmaker that has previously came close to this feeling is David Lynch.Even if we have seen these naturalistic dream worlds before from Miyazaki and similar stories of children in hostile surreal situations like Pan’s Labyrinth or Chronicles of Narnia, it’s the filmmaking here that stands above— the musicality of the film (Hisaishi outdoes himself) and the inspired melancholic minimalism of the artwork. It’s just the undeniable beauty a master in his workshop tinkering with his toys.added:Miyazaki Ranked,Ghibli Ranked,2023 Ranked"

Its almost as if to say that if the fate of the world had been in the hands of the future generation instead of the previous, none of it would have happened. That one must entrust the world to young people, instead of manipulating or oppressing them.

They haven’t flown in so long.”It’s always special to watch a film by a filmmaker who evidently feels as though they are at the end of their career, even more so when that filmmaker is someone with a mind as privileged as Hayao Miyazaki’s.There is no denying that Studio Ghibli’s films resonate with many people around the world, and in my opinion it has to do with the way in which he portrays real issues and human emotions through fantastical stories and characters that are filled with whimsy.Unfortunately, his work is just not for me, and while I found it to be cute and entertaining at times I simply could not connect withThe Boy and the Heron.A gripe I’ve always had with Ghibli films is how rushed everything seems. Connections just exist but they don’t really form, so when the relationships they span get tested I can’t seem to care all that much, something that seemed especially evident here with Mahito’s and Natsuko’s bond.I would have loved to see more of the Great Uncle’s story, especially considering it seems like one of Miyazaki’s most autobiographical characters to date.These films pack a very strong emotional punch in their endings, I just wish those endings felt earned."

It's like he's asking, \"What the hell are you guys gonna do without me?\" Which is a good question!Even if this isn't his last movie, it undeniably feels like a goodbye purposely made to express a life flashing before your eyes, a straight shot of the world's beauty, pain, & suffering all at once. He simplifies the complicated in ways other directors could only dream of, once again creating a magical world imbued with childhood intuition and spirit, obsessively animated to fill the frame with natural beauty. What can sometimes feel like a series of greatest hits also features some of the darkest moments of his career that hint towards a bittersweet reckoning over the artist's own life, career, and inevitable death. In part, asking, \"Was it worth it?\" to suffer the pain of spending a lifetime dedicated to a craft that inspired millions but, in turn, left you cursed to live alone inside the worlds you've created.The story focuses on a young boy yearning to be reunited with the mother he lost. He then finds himself on a weird, wonderful boyhood odyssey inside a fantastical world that mirrors our own. Though it effectively works as a sprawling epic about processing one's grief, there is far more to gain from the film's central question. This is why the actual title \"How Do You Live?\" is inherently superior to the international one. He's asking this question on multiple levels that challenge our interpretations of the happenings in our lives, specifically the hard goodbyes that make us feel like life can't go on without that something or someone we lost. But it does, and ultimately, it's up to us to see the beauty in this never-ending cycle of life, death, and then life again."

This might be the best autobiographical flic there may ever is without even showing to be one. The subjects being spoken out here and their characters felt so relatable I couldn't believe it would be possible to tell in a animated movie EVER!To cut a big cake little: MASTERPIECE---------------------------------------------------------10/10💯% recommendable ✅✅✅✅✅"

        "review": "Animation takes precedence over coherent narration in this dark fable on accepting death, and a boy’s struggle over spiritual growth and humanities redemption. But when Miyazaki holds the helm one is always more forgiving, especially when each drawing is of a pictorial beauty seldom seen, let alone experienced.From the rush into the fire in the beginning, to the tranquil splendour of the countryside, and ending in a fabulously detailed fantasy world: each moving image holds a hundred marvels. Instead of a clear story arch or plot line, one gets thrown into a succession of a thousand tableaus. The boy and his mischievous, trickster-like heron, bring us always upwards, from fire and earth, to water and air, ending in the philosophical and symbolic cosmos which is referenced in the Japanese title of the film: “how do you life?” - the name of a 1937 eponymous novel, probably holding autobiographical significance for the aging Miyazaki.Is this his final farewell to cinema? Linking themes and tonal shifts from his earlier work to a powerful, and in the end optimistic message of change? Has he delivered his final clarion call, urging us to create “a world without conflict with your own hands”? Time will tell. But with this movie Miyazaki once again demonstrates that the power of creation itself might possibly hold humanities strongest and most precious gift for the future.Studio Ghibli ranked"

We have a bond so strong i struggle daily after i got old enough to realise she won't always be here if the course of nature trots along like it should, i share most of the meaningful art in my life to her and this is no exception.When a 12:30 pm saturday screening of this popped up in the cinema schedule, i thought that there couldn't be a more perfect time for a mother daughter cinema trip, and i was right.The liminal space of a 12:30 pm screening is already powerful, but this one was indeed a portal we will never find once we let go of the doorknob, and naturally we are forced to after the 2 hours of allotted is time up. But it is 2 hours i will cherish for a while.The older i get the more sentimental i get (somehow) and things i never used to think about occupy my head in new ways. This was my third time seeing it, and every time i have laughed and cried at the same spots, no one in the theater seemingly followed the same pattern. Watching it with my mom i realised she was chuckling and sobbing at the exact same spots for exactly the same reasons. Rarely in my life has something presented itself to me so directly and unmistakably and it made me want to laugh and cry even more.We mirror each other, a fact i have tried to escape through a bit of a trauma-induced neurodivergency-inflated elongated teenage rebellion phase. I want to be my own person, i am my own person, most of this person is the same person as my mom; this is ok.Because i am now old enough to feel incredibly deeply that having a person that shares your dna and a bond you can't escape isn't something to escape from.It took me a long time to find myself, i was constantly angry but mostly inward and without really comprehending why, after a few things clicked in place (being trans, lesbian, neurodivergent, worn down by inhumanely heavy grief i didn't know i carried) i came into my own and especially at this point in my life, a turning point that happened the day i saw Everything Everywhere All At Once and it rocked my world (I don't actually know how good this movie is now, but it hit exactly what it needed to hit at the right moment in my life, so i have no intention of ruining that image whatsoever) i have gone from occasional glimpses of nice moments to a life i love and love being in.And with this i have an entirely new relationship with my mom, because i can finally love myself as well now.No matter what happens and has happened, she will always be my mom and i will always be her daughter, i am so unbelievably grateful and happy for this, and watching this movie makes me think about how much i love her and always will. And how good it feels to finally be able to say these things, i wasn't a very good person for the first part of my life whether that was or wasn't my fault or everyone's or no one's fault at all, but i am incredibly happy that i am at a place where it doesn't really matter anymore.It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. We age and we lose people and things and ourselves and memory and pretty much anything you could list, we grieve these things and it makes us upset, but the reason we do is because we had something and now there is nothing; the something is eternal even when it is nothing and beyond reach. Maybe it's hard to think these things when they aren't gone, maybe (or definitely actually) it is hard to think this when they are gone. Some never do, but if you have someone, anyone, and you love them it is enough to have thought this once. It is ok to think it after the fact too.I hug my mom fully in the knowledge that one day she will just not exist in the world, more often than not it is in the back of my head most of the day. For a while i tried to run away from that fact with her and every family member, a mix of trauma and dysphoria; the unbearable thought that everyone will be gone and that none of them will know the real me. Now the real me exists, and i hug my mom and the thought is still there in the back of my mind. But now more than ever: there is not a single timeline i wouldn't hug her, forever until the end of time as long as i have the opportunity.For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kindHarder days coming, maybeI don't mindSounds kind of dumb when I say it but it's trueI would do anything for you-the Mountain Goats, Genesis 30:3"

        "review": "A meditation on the passage of time, learning to confront loss without backsliding into the poisonous trap of nostalgia and fantasy. The only way forward is to forgive and accept, embrace your worst fears and antagonists, use these experiences to propel you instead of hold you back. To this point you can be as well read and experienced and still remain ignorant. A man alone in a room desperately trying to keep a precarious stack of blocks from falling over; willing to ruin real lives in order to maintain the dream of the false ones indefinitely.Miyazaki isn’t asking his audience to consider these lessons, he’s demanding it. Life is cruel, relentless and without reason — accept this now or suffer. It seems like an obvious choice but you’d be surprised at our capacity for denial. Mahito would rather physically hurt himself than accept a new reality he finds too painful to confront. He’d rather attempt to kill another living being rather than accept it for what it is, neither friend nor ally. So ruled by grief compounded by hatred and the terror of acceptance — and who can blame him? But disappearing only opens up more holes, it does not bind or mend.Saw this in Japanese at MoMA and felt sort of mixed by the end, a lot happening that seemed to open more questions than it answered for me. Took me a few hours to think about it and now I’m looking forward to seeing it again with all of this in mind when it opens in theaters."

The first twenty to thirty minutes of the film feel like a Hamaguchi film, setting up questions about everything- morality, fate and predestination. Have to see this again because it’s so dense and I think it might even divide Miyazaki fans, but I adored it. It’s a truly wonderful singular work of art an auteur could only make at this part of their career."

Which is saying something! Darkly funny and self-reflexive in a way that caught me off guard. Wind Rises -- a masterpiece to be sure! -- that's a movie that feels like a dude retiring. The Boy and the Heron doesn't feel like that.

        "review": "Unha obra sorprendentemente esixente para o espectador, salvo, tal vez, que sexas unha crianza. A súa mestura de Peter Pan + Alicia no país das marabillas sinto que molestará, sobre todo, a adultos obsesionados con certas formas académicas de narración, non particularmente a miradas infantís máis abertos a este tipo de propostas formais. Sobre todo moi sorprendente no contexto da obra de Miyazaki. Nunca o vin traballae primeiro, cunha estrutura tan abstracta e, segundo, nalgo tonalmente tan atípico.Sobre o primeiro resulta sorprendente como a primeira media hora, aproximo, ten unha aproximación marcadamente costumbrista, salvo polas pequenas intromisións da garza, para no resto da obra desenvolverse nun terreo puramente episódico de ramificacións sen final e con relacións, en moitos casos, puramente simbólicas ou de repetición de elementos. Esa primeira hora fixo que me lembrara dese vídeo de Miyazaki criticando unha IA con bastante dureza. Se por algo destaca, incluso sobre outros directores de Ghibli, e na precisa atención a pequenos detalles de vida que cobran especial magnitude por ser animación. Penso, por exemplo, na forma na que, o carro que vai levalos á súa nova casa, desestabilízase e perde o equilibrio co peso da xente que vai subindo; ou na decisión, relativamente contraintuitiva, de ensartar un plano do pé manchándose de barro movéndose pola natureza. Ten moito de rexistro e imitación de pequenos xestos, pero sobre todo fai sentir que todo se senta especialmente vivo, que eses corpos teñen fisicidade e relación ca súa contorna, que a relación entre eses elementos non existe en distintos planos, senón que consegue interactuar entre eles. Hai un vídeo por internet dunha corrección de Miyazaki a un aprendiz, onde critícalle que unha nena pequena comía na mesa como se o corpo fora da mesma altura que os adultos, logo comeza a presentar certos movementos ou accións que as crianzas tenden facer cando están nesa situación, como moven o corpo, como colocan a cadeira, como se frustran por non alcanzar certas cousas. Toda esa construción por detalles é esencial para esa primeira parte da longametraxe, porque existe un sentimento de aventura, pero presentado dende o terreo máis ordinario posible: moverse por ruínas, camiñar pola natureza, investigar unha nova casa... Presentado dende as capacidades e as sensacións de abraio dun neno pequeno. Moita xente queixouse desta primeira media hora, que para min xa resulta emocionante, pero, sobre todo, é necesario toda esta duración para asentar un contexto histórico sobre o que cimentar todos uns códigos visuais e elementos iconográficos que van ser a esencia da segunda parte da obra. Porque se esa primeira parte ten unha estrutura bastante clásica de detonante dramática e misterios a resolver, a segunda metade é todo un xogo formal, de estrutura cambiante que utiliza certos símbolos previamente presentados na súa forma de reflexo e repetición, presentando unha ligazón de ideas aberta, pouco asumible por lóxicas causais e que procuran unha lóxica que funcione sobre un sentido propio da obra.Esta forma de sentido lóxico propio é absolutamente prodixiosa, cunha ausencia de entendementos clásicos da temporalidade, da espacialidade e ata da ficción. Vemos cuartos e corredoiros que dan a lugares que nunca deberían dar, vemos personaxes do pasado, do presente e ata posiblemente do futuro coexistindo nun mesmo plano; e ata a ficción ten un papel propio, vemos a obra que está a adaptar \"Como vives?\" de Genzaburo Yoshino, sabemos, para quen tivemos a sorte de ler a novela, de certos paralelismos entre a súa historia e o libro, incluso entre a fantasía posterior e o libro, pequenos detalles que se repiten na relación co tío, no contexto histórico, no desenvolvemento persoal e na situación familiar da posguerra, pero nunca deixan de ser, outra vez, reflexos, dobres, de realidades semellantes que non coinciden exactamente, pero que se relacionan dalgunha maneira.Toda esa lóxica propia adáptase a cuestión tonal, disruptiva constantemente consigo mesma. Hai pouco criticaba como as visións do diabo de gran parte do cinema de terror evidénciano como horror, algo feito só para dar medo e que ninguén poida afrontarse a iso dende outra emoción, cando gran parte das obras medievais que máis me interesan da representación do demoníaco son máis ambiguas, non tan planas na súa presentación, son terroríficas, pero tamén moi graciosas, algo ridículas, hai un espazo para todo ese abanico emocional porque hai unha aposta atrevida por deseños ambiguos. Hai moito diso aquí, tanto no deseño de personaxes como na propia forma de dirixir as secuencias. A garza, por exemplo, é preciosa, elegante en moitas secuencias; cando lle saen os dentes e o nariz do home é inquietante, sen ningún tipo de reparo a dar medo as crianzas, pero ten algo na forma de moverse e falar que o fai tamén ridícula, moi cómica e cando se evidencia o homiño que está baixo ese disfrace viviches emocións contraditorias á vez sobre un único elemento. Os periquitos son adorables, teñen unha cara de parvo que ninguén lles quita, resultan terroríficos, literalmente comen crianzas, pero logo despréndense deles cun golpe estilo looney tunes e, ata cando van comer o neno protagonista, fan un xesto divertidísimo indicándolle que vai ser a cea. Toda esta inestabilidade tonal fai a obra máis rara, máis complexa de aproximarse a ela, é emocionante non nun sentido habitual da palabra, de que un chora véndoa, senón que é emocionante nun sentido que hai unha aposta polas emocións constantes, fluidas e contraditorias. Iso leva a que, ás veces, sexa anticlimática, tanto nos seus misterios (ningún se resolve, algún só se presenta, como toda a trama do meteorito), como na súa parte emocional (resulta sorprendente a velocidade coa que se resolven certos conflitos). Moita xente lera iso como que funciona peor emocionalmente, pero para min é un caso onde funciona peor fai que a obra sexa máis interesante (sobre todo, léndoa neste contexto da súa carreira).Non é das miñas favoritas de Miyazaki, pero si é das que máis admiro e máis tivo potencial de sorprenderme. Se alguén viñera dicirme \"esta é a miña preferida súa\", pensaría que é a opinión dun absoluto chad, pese a que eu non poida compartila. Ó saír falei cunha persoa que saíra decepcionado, conversándoa sentinme bastante nula para defendela. Sinto que é desas obras que é moi doado apuntar que pode non funcionar nelas, pero moito máis complicado e abstracto de apuntar onde está o emocionante, porque implica que o desfrutas da viaxe de forma intuitiva ou, no caso de querer racionalizala e comentala, toca mover toda a túa estrutura de pensamento a unha lóxicas moi propias desta obra."

Maybe we should trust that even if can’t understand it yet.”Until about a week ago (so I think?), The Boy and the Heron was long-labelled as Miyazaki’s last film; a major statement for a master of animation whose decades in film have massively inspired so many. Although this does in many ways feel like a final film — ‘How Do You Live?’ would’ve been a much more appropriate title — this is also bursting with so much life and eagerness, but is inherently shimmering with an air of experience and maturity that only a master of the art like Miyazaki could evoke and embody, especially in how painterly this film is in the world it immerses us into. Grief here is an internal world of fantastical proportions, and in diving headfirst into grief, in coming to terms with it, Miyazaki exposes us to the beauty and awe of truly and fully embracing love in the face of grief as a way of moving on and accepting our lives for what it is. This not-any-longer final film of Miyazaki’s is special, as magical as it is cathartic. Makes me wonder: how do we live?"

What else is new?I’m wary of calling this messy, as, at the end of the day, the ultra expansive, dreamlike quality ofThe Boy and the Heronis what makes it what it is, but my goodness is this a lot to take in. At times exceedingly meditative, and at others overwhelmingly brisk, it guides us through countless (and absolutely delightful) ideas and concepts with striking depth, but nowhere near as much clarity. In other words, I need to watch it again.What I can say, however, is that this is unlike anything Miyazaki, or Ghibli as a whole (I think, still need to watch all of them) has ever done. Sure fantasy realms are nothing new in the studio’s history, but how it’s populated feels thoroughly unique. It’s extremely loose in its how it builds these things up, which may make its writing seem a bit too frenetic, but ultimately just results in some of the most ambitious and compelling world building I’ve seen in this decade yet. Half a century into their career and Miyazaki’s sense of magic has not lost an ounce of its power. I could’ve gotten lost here forever, marveling at every single thing that came my way.Of course, anyone who’s seen the film would see that the narrative’s emotional impact is only as strong as it is through its more grounded elements. The movie’s core runs between these two measures of surrealism and effortlessly weaves them to craft a story about, well, stories. It looks back onto Miyazaki’s illustrious career, with all the nuance that he’s experienced through it, and allows him to reconcile with all that he’s been through in order to reckon with the idea of a coming end.Miyazaki has made it clear at this point that he’s not planning on leaving the movie field anytime soon, yetThe Boy and the Heronstill feels like an astonishing thesis statement for what he wants to say with it all. Although not quite as impressive as something likeThe Wind Rises, it’s just as thoughtfully reflexive, to the point it would’ve made for a remarkable end point. I don’t know if I would call the end product one of their finer films, but this is Miyazaki we’re talking about. With almost any other filmmaker, I’d almost certainly be saying different."

        "review": "Tellement heureuse de retrouver l'univers de Miyazaki sur grand écran ça m'a même un peu émue ; j'avais des attentes extrêmement haute et j'ai constaté en sortant de la séance, et malgré moi, que j'ai été un tout petit peu déçue. (un tout petit peu j'ai dit)Miyazaki réalise ici un véritable film somme, peut-être un de ses plus complexes, extrêmement référencé : Miyazaki cite Miyazaki, c'est indéniable, et il dissémine ça et là tout ce qui fait son cinéma, et beaucoup de clins d’œil à ses précédents films. Et si c'est merveilleux à voir, je peux pas m'empêcher de me dire que ça peut être un défaut : si on ne connaît pas sa filmo, on passe à côté de beaucoup de choses.Et s'il se cite, il réalise pourtant dans le même temps une œuvre tellement différente de ses précédentes. Il va tellement plus loin, et plus que tout, il offre une réflexion géniale sur son œuvre globale, questionne la création d'un univers et son univers (et une scène en particulier l'explicite). En cela, j'ai trouvé Le Garçon et le Héron véritablement plus complexe dans ses multiples structures. Les films du monsieur n'ont jamais eu une seule clé de lecture, bien sûr, mais ici, c'est encore plus palpable.J'ai été bouleversée par l'ensemble des personnages féminins qui sont parmi les plus remarquablement écrits. Vraiment BÉTONVisuellement, j'ai l'impression qu'on a encore franchi des étapes, des nouvelles idées de mise en scène encore jamais vues (l'ouverture est grandiose) et j'ai été émue de retrouver la beauté de ces planches, ces fonds aussi chatoyants.Vraiment un très gros morceau, que j'aimerais revoir, mais aux qualités indéniables (peut-être que je note un peu durement).Update le lendemain : le film a encore eu le temps de grandir en moi, c’est vraiment trop big en fait"

Rewatch after no subbed Japan projection and it’s funny how Miyazaki manages to worldbuild his fantasy (through dialogue) without giving it a finished shape, shifting it according to Mahito and his struggles. All the doubles and correspondences between reality and imagination have never the fantasy coherence, they are the surrealistic failures of a life (and a career) that cannot live without contradiction. Maybe my most cried movie of all time.www.filmtv.it/film/213269/il-ragazzo-e-l-airone/recensioni/1028988/#rfr:none"

Honoured to be able to see the Japanese premiere for it.I don’t know where this stands in the greater pantheon of Studio Ghibli films, but I am deeply appreciative of what this movie sets out to do. You aren’t required to watch any of the movies, nor know any of the meta narrative surrounding this film. However, if you do, they certainly add layers to the adventure.The magic of its traditional 2D animation with the added experience from years of filmmaking makes this a spectacle. I hope it comes out to the West for people to watch sooner rather than later!"

This thing is pure vibe, a brush of raw emotion on the beautiful beautiful canvas of Ghibli’s signature hand-drawn animation. The old master’s attempt of getting rid of rigid narrative logic, structure by directly hammering feelings into audiences is admirable, he’s outdone himself thru unrelenting artistic exploration paired with impeccable adept and helmed a late career masterpiece that could be a grandly fitting swan song if that’s the case.The Boy and the Heron is an instant classic and Miyazaki’s magnum opus, paying tribute to his own filmography while telling a devastating story of, well, everything he’s done and so much more. It’s his grandest and most intimate work ever, it’s the embodiment of his transformation as an artist and who he is, how he truly views the world."

She’s someone my dad likes.”Hayao Miyazaki’sThe Boy and the Heronis an incredible conclusion to one of the most decorated careers in cinema. There is speculation that this is not his last film but after watching it, I find that hard to believe. Miyazaki has filled this film with his most disturbing thoughts, passionate dreams, aching questions and facing his own mortality. The most dense and complex film of his career. The Granduncle for example. It felt like he represented Miyazaki himself. A world of fantasy and an entire legacy crumbling. Death and birth happening all at once. Too much to discuss with this one, but off first watch it feels like a Top 3 contender. Also feels like a Greatest Hits of the Ghibli cannon. Lots of similarities with his classics. Immense but definitely will be polarizing when it gets a wide release.92/100"

        "review": "80:Miyazaki in his maximalist form, and while placing such grandiose world-building in the film’s forefront poses some problems, it makes for his most captivating audiovisual experience in a very long time. (I’d argue it’s his best since, perhaps,Spirited Away? It’s certainly not as good, don’t get me wrong, but I haven’t been too impressed with his work since.) I have a difficult time describing what about this film worked for me—it’s one of those movies where you have to see to believe because there are sporadic moments where it truly borders on “transcendent”—but it’s much easier to pinpoint what exactly about the film didn’t work for me. By all means, this is “Miyazaki’s” film, in the sense that I find this story of death and grief more narratively coherent and layered when you place the director as a self-insert for the protagonist, which is somewhat a double-edged sword. Because, frankly, the protagonist’s arc is admittedly rushed, drowned out by the countless subplots and the extravengely-developed-to-a-fault worlds this movie explores with such meandering patience. However, I concede that once Miyazaki kicks into that signature high-gear surreal fantasy, the film’s faults become an afterthought."

You cherish, appreciate and hold on to it.That's just my way of saying that any quibbling on The Boy and the Heron's storytelling swiftly washes away with the tide here. This isn't a new blockbuster release from Johnny McMovie, this is an old tired man crawling out of bed and realising he can't go on, can't breathe another second, without making art and telling stories. His curse and our blessing.Really good. It's the most understated, introspected, of his work despite the fantastical images. A beautiful gift of tender animation, magical storytelling and equally soft Joe Hisaishi piano solo's.

It's a whimsical tale of loss, grief, acceptance and letting go told through Miyazaki's magical and amazingly charming vision, making for an unforgettable theater experience of which I highly recommend it's in IMAX! I sadly didn't get to see it in IMAX but when it releases in theaters I'll definitely rewatch it in IMAX, because oh my god, the visuals, the score, the animation...it's so wonderful to look at.It did take a while to get going for me. Miyazaki usually takes his time to make the storyactuallyinteresting and this one is no different. He invites you into this warmhearted world that is unique and charming but also feels kind of boring. It's a fine enough introduction to the movie but I wasn't particularly hooked until the second act came around. Because when the second act came around, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. This is the definition of pure 'eye candy'. It's such a delightful world to experience and look at that you almost forget time.The themes of the movie are really good too. They're a little unfocused and it takes you a while to unravel them but once you do, you realize how wonderful this journey has been from beginning to end and how much it must've meant to Miyazaki. This feeling of missed chances and accepting the loss of a lost one was handled so powerfully and it hit me really hard in the final ten to five minutes. Absolutely astonishing work.Overall, The Boy and the Heron is a must-see and a great way to cap off my journey at LIFF!"

"朋友問我為什麼喜歡《蒼鷺與少年》，我說，因為我不覺得看懂是最重要的事。上面那句話，想必有些人不會認同，我也不想爭論把故事說清楚是創作者的基本責任，還是你們就只在乎劇情──我顯然是個宮﨑駿迷，但我不會對他特別寬容。正因為如此熟悉他的手法、慣用元素、美學風格與主題，還能被這樣一段電光火石間、萬羽千帆的旅程一直抓著注意力，拉扯情感，以致於忽略了懂不懂⋯⋯讓我知道這是更難得，也更難的。所以我把結論說在前面：《蒼鷺與少年》最讓我感動的，是看見宮﨑駿依然在處理新課題。這故事設定有缺漏，一些細節也有工期不穩的痕跡，但它的情感篤定、專注而且赤誠。要客觀評價，我會說邏輯的不完整難以辯駁，可作為影迷，我看見一位年邁導演依然有顆火熱的心，充滿慨嘆、憐惜、困惑與好奇。這些念想，化作一股巨大動能，流暢而超展開地帶我去到一片新天地。在那裡，空氣中有一絲清新。這還不叫人驚喜嗎？一、【毫不停歇，毫無保留的夢遊仙境】《蒼鷺與少年》的體裁是《愛麗絲夢遊仙境》，從蒼鷺（戴懷錶的兔子）鑽入塔頂（樹洞）開始，真人就踏上一段心與身的幻途。這當然似曾相識，一如《神隱少女》或是《龍貓》──甚至再放寬一點，《天空之城》、《魔法公主》和《霍爾的移動城堡》都是因為一場偶遇而展開的公路之旅，主角都有清楚的動機，也都在旅途上遇到其它人與事，完成心理的弧線。真人的角色核心，是他失去了媽媽，無助地想救回她。這是個還不懂得世界、就失去半個天空的少年，面對外界的劇變：戰爭亂世、爸爸再娶、突然被「安置」到新家與家人中，母親的死對他而言，不只是「無所依」的衝擊，還有某種（身為男性被教導的）愧疚感。不知道如何處理情緒，於是他執石自傷；當蒼鷺宣稱「你母親在這裡」，他說「那一定是謊言，但我想親自去確認。」記得嗎？那段落一開始，其實是真人和婆婆們要去找夏子，但最後誘他入塔的，是再見到媽媽的欲望。不過，在進入下世界（下の世界）之後，故事推力就從真人的動機，被該世界的奇觀──或更偏向「意境」的展演──給取代了。他變成觀察者／學習者，在種種體驗中成長，這也是宮﨑駿最拿手的：在無盡亡靈之帆的海上捕魚，在鵜鶘一族的宿命中領會生存的殘酷，在大舅公的慨嘆裡感受權與位的虛妄⋯⋯這之間節奏的收放、情感的流向，都很「宮﨑駿」。譬如捕魚那段，就是再度以水療法（註1）讓激烈的冒險喘口氣。你我在讚嘆、好奇與思忖間，想像真人內心的百感，而世界覆滅的危機在即，得趕快做決定──這整趟停不下來的，夢與幻的歷險，讓我感到宮﨑駿的毫無保留，他的沒打算「下一回分曉」，他的把想說、想畫的通通記下來的一股腦。還有，他一直沒碰過，不曾面對的情感面向。二、【用一片烈火完成母親的交棒】《蒼鷺與少年》讓我看到宮﨑駿終於處理了對母親／女性的執迷，而且是這兩者的交織關係。自他幼年，母親便患了結核病，原本活潑、好動的宮﨑媽媽變得像《龍貓》片中，頻繁進出醫院，性情也不再開朗。這是為何，宮﨑駿的故事常是「母不在」的，但又充滿各式代理母性的形象──熱血的朵拉，溫暖的索諾，嚴厲的莫娜，理性的黑帽子，還有湯婆婆、錢婆婆⋯⋯。另一方面，他筆下那些（肯定令他自己很著迷的）女孩們，大多善解人意，善良溫暖，還善於照顧人，可謂傳統母愛的典範。這樣的嚮往（所謂直男的目光）並不稀奇，過去這兩類角色──去性化的女性長輩與可人的女孩同伴──也都區隔清晰。但到了《蒼鷺與少年》，我驚喜地發現，宮﨑駿不但在處理對母親的愛，還進一步試探界線，看這情感如何影響慾望。一如《風起》既是向來反戰又熱愛飛機／武器的他，終於直面其中的矛盾，也是他在面對自己能存活、是因為父親在戰時靠著軍武致富的負罪感，在生涯末期的兩部作品中，宮﨑駿選擇了和雙親對話。《蒼鷺與少年》除了有更直白的經營戰機工廠的父親，有印著螺旋槳花紋的棉被，還有三位「母親」：開場已逝的真人生母（久子），父親續弦的夏子阿姨，以及下世界的火美──即年輕的久子。在這些角色間，有兩股意念在流動，一是對母親身份（稱謂）的肯認／冀求，二是啟蒙期的少年要在對母親的依戀中，感受對異性的嚮往。前面提過，真人的角色動機是失去母親、想找回她，這在後半被「救回夏子」悄悄地置換了。久子與夏子除了髮色稍有差異，五官和造型基本相同，宮﨑駿不可能不是故意的──那張長椅上的女子，真人一看就喊媽媽，但你我無法分辨。在外人眼裡可被替換（interchangeable）的母親身份／照顧行為，在孩子眼中當然不是；或者，是或不是只在一念間，只在主觀的心境認定。這裡，從夏子阿姨到後段「夏子媽媽」的轉變，說實話在感人之餘，是有點突兀的。一方面是宮﨑駿不擅長描繪母子關係（根本從未看過吧），二方面是夏子角色的經營不足。這實在可惜，因為她是我認為片中最有趣的角色，連結了最有趣的一個面向：從夏子亮相的第一個鏡頭，特寫她下車的身姿，到夜裡只聞其聲的號稱「吉卜力史上最大人場面」的吻戲，再到那句「夏子是你喜歡的人嗎？」「是爸爸喜歡的人」，宮﨑駿都（也許根本無意識地）在凸顯夏子作為慾望對象──或用不嚇人一點的說法，是做為「異性」，令真人在意的存在感。有場關鍵的戲，是蒼鷺第一次現出真身後，真人被蟾蜍纏上，夏子以弓箭為他解圍。那之後，真人就非常執著於要一把自己的弓，而我忍不住要說：這就是中二男孩有了仰慕對象的行為啊！有趣的是，那場衝突後真人一度昏厥，夢中的他在水裡上浮，此處子宮／水的意象又可以解讀作：他被（新的母親）重新生了一次。可惜，夏子的母親／女性雙重性在進入下世界後，就被擱置了，直接跳到「夏子媽媽！」的大轉折（註2）；另一方面，異性他者的位置則是被火美取代。火美與真人的戲不長，動人、親暱而且乾淨（註3），這角色的真正價值，是回頭完滿了久子的意志。真人放不下的母親，自開場便成了符號化的存在，她的死亡拉扯著他，也推動故事。那片在夢中兩度重現的火，到了後半又燒過一回：在那座產房外，為了拯救被怒風纏身的妹妹與兒子，火美不顧法力受限，發動焰火，即使觸犯天意也要讓夏子跟「即將成為你兒子的男孩」一起回到現實──用一場火炎完成母親身份的交棒，這就是《蒼鷺與少年》的核心。這也讓久子有了主體性，甚至可以說，整個故事就是她意志的展現。有趣的是，這趟歷險的促成，即塔與塔主（與蒼鷺？）的動機，就是要讓真人理解並接受「交棒」。只是最後沒有發生在父權（社會權位）結構上，而是母親的故事上。但那座塔的意涵，只有如此嗎？三、【面貌變化不停的下の世界】自《紅豬》開始，宮﨑駿筆下的奇幻界開始有「死亡」的意象，這在《神隱少女》最具體，但像《蒼鷺與少年》這樣直白地說出「死亡的氣味」、「亡魂不能殺生所以要我來」、「他們要去投胎做人」，還真是第一次。只是，這一切都被包裝在屬性未明的「下世界」裡。在此，下世界看似相對於陽世的陰間，或靈魂投胎轉運站的「the great beyond／great before」，又似乎只是大舅公靠著外星隕石創造的口袋宇宙──畢竟鵜鶘和鸚鵡都說了，牠們是被「帶進來」的。它是有著返老還童、青春永駐意涵的 Neverland，也是「汝不得尋求知識」的伊甸園。但不論怎麼設定，只要是個「世界」就難逃罪與惡的侵蝕，所以有代表法西斯的鸚鵡，有象徵階級宿命的鵜鶘。而大舅公為此而慨嘆。甚至，許多評論也都看到「傳承」的意涵，即塔主／大舅公就是宮﨑駿的自況：我遊遍古今異地，收集了十三個純潔的故事，為你們打造一個新世界，但你們不一定要繼承它，也可以回到自己的生命、回到被火焰吞噬的現實，去面對屬於你們的課題。這是在對觀眾，對他的創作永遠在獻予的「新世代的孩子們」喊話嗎？（再考慮到塔主繼承的「血緣」契約，又讓人倒抽一口氣──難道，這又要扣回我們在戲外已經聽了二十年，聽到都麻痺了的父子心結⋯⋯）誠實地說，我認為下世界的設定不明，是《蒼鷺與少年》的硬傷，禁不起太仔細的推敲或是腦補。這終究是個氣勢優先、意境取勝的舞台：一揮就有火圈灑落的短棒，一縱身就能穿梭火苗的少女，無聲漂浮在半空中的巨石，向著滿月飛升的靈體們⋯⋯這些風景透露宮﨑駿的任性，他那「我說了算」的霸氣，與已臻幻術的畫功。但要說他仔細探討了死亡，仍然有點牽強。況且，我還從中看到了一點力不從心。四、【從以「人」為本，到以「可能性」為本】上面提到，宮﨑駿常在畫《愛麗絲夢遊仙境》，因為這很適合他的創作習慣。他不是把劇情都想好、分場都畫完才動工，而是在構思階段畫下幾張關鍵的圖像／風景，再以此定錨，有了大方向，就從頭開始一邊畫、一邊想。這樣做的好處是：敘事焦點往往清晰而連貫，情緒也很集中，但相對地要顧全大局（在故事或設定上），就要靠直覺、經驗了。這是為何，早期的長片除了有漫畫為本的《風之谷》，大多情節與設定都小巧、簡潔，要到《紅豬》才開始有指向視界外／敘事疆界外的意象段落。這說與不說的拿捏，到了《神隱少女》最完美，整幢油屋和千尋一眾在水上電車所見，都在暗示著整個「故事」只是異世界的冰山一角。但同時，那一切未知，並不會侵蝕敘事的完整性。那之後，宮﨑駿開始逐漸放飛，《霍爾的移動城堡》的戰爭全貌和格局，《崖上的波妞》的人／海世界觀，都因為缺乏交代，而讓情節核心有一塊是虛浮的。到了《蒼鷺與少年》是久子姐妹與下世界的情感關係空白，是蒼鷺一角的動機未明，是好像說得通又不夠嚴謹的時空旅行，是整個下世界的邏輯設定──沒錯，敘事者沒有義務樣樣都說明，但這些留白直接影響了夏子、大舅公和甚至婆婆們等關鍵配角的意義。這個症頭──我得承認，在看之前我就有預期了。宮﨑駿的故事邊界，在《神隱少女》前後有著向內、向外的質地差異，因為到千尋為止，作品核心都是「角色」，是主角的故事，所以世界可以很開放，但主角及其歷程是完整而向內、圓滿的。但從霍爾（應該說蘇菲）開始，旅程及其風景、意境等等帶有「可能性」，指向敘事邊界外的元素，越來越上位，作品的核心便不再是角色，而是導演的眼睛所見。正因為他的創作非常聚焦當下、眼前，一旦失去了全觀，背景世界的邏輯和甚至角色思路，都會讓路給導演的意志。雖然靠著迷人的畫功──想想蒼鷺在水面的步伐，火美在夜船的身影，霧子俐落操帆的英姿──而讓敘事強度不至於打折，但作為評論者要挖掘和爬梳，就不免挫折。但說到底，這就是某種力不從心吧。《蒼鷺與少年》的超長製作期，「一個月畫一分鐘」的艱鉅，讓我這些年早已相信根本不會有相見之日。最後成品中，角色的五官會在遠景變成簡陋的點和線，這在過去從沒發生過；片中也有讓我疑惑的分鏡（註4），連收尾都有點戛然突兀。而這一切讓我看到了「取捨」，畢竟創作不可能無限拖延，當打折的效率遇上期限，就變成趕工的痕跡了。五、【最值得的一件事】但終究，說了這麼多，我還是想回到粉絲的眼光做結。看《蒼鷺與少年》，是從第一分鐘就開始的驚喜：那場火災，所有背景人物灰黑、歪斜、慌亂和恐懼滿溢，是不曾見過的新畫風，連真人爬木梯的姿態都像《魔法公主》裡的魔物般張狂，讓我看到宮﨑駿的毫不示弱，沒有要收斂的意思。於是我在社群上說了：比起安全而無力的創作，看到這樣霸氣超展開、充滿活力的故事，我真是開心一萬倍。宮﨑駿曾說過──現在的他搞不好不會認帳──一個創作者的黃金階段只有十年。於是我常在想：他的黃金十年是哪一段？也許是從《魔女宅急便》、《紅豬》、《魔法公主》到《神隱少女》的十年吧。有過那樣的自在、遠颺、悠然和慈悲，創作之路已然完滿，那之後的，都是他陪我們、我們也陪著他，試試看還有什麼好玩的。而這一晃眼，又是二十年。過去一個禮拜，我緩慢刻著這篇文章，一邊跟自己說：這很可能是最後一次，我能寫宮﨑駿的院線影評了。所以說什麼我都要寫好它。而我最後仍會想起，他在紀錄片《宮﨑駿：十載同行》中畫著《崖上的波妞》裡的辰婆婆，一邊思念著母親；以及畫到後來卡關了，收到老戰友久石讓作曲、其女麻衣演唱的〈向日葵之家圓舞曲〉，邊聽邊掉淚。那首歌詞唱的是：「多麼想能夠再一次翩翩起舞，像風一樣。」在《風起》最後，菜穗子來到夢中對二郎告別，她說：你要活下去。在《神隱少女》最後，千尋問白龍我們會再相見嗎？他說一定會的。而在《蒼鷺與少年》，火美告訴真人，即使注定會消逝，「但是可以把你生下來，這不是很值得的一件事嗎？」不論如何，花上十年把一部長篇動畫生下來，真是太值得的一件事了。宮﨑駿哪，我們會再見嗎？這不會是再見吧？—註1：作家謝海盟曾寫道，侯孝賢形容宮﨑駿有個創作習慣，是在冒險中途放入一場靜謐的戲，以調節呼吸，而那場戲往往跟水有關。最具代表性的當然是《神隱少女》的水上電車，而《魔法公主》的山獸神池塘也是。註2：至此我們或許可以說，肯認媽媽身份的同時，也是「去性化」儀式的完成嗎？──這麼精神分析的典型命題，我想還是交給專家來談比較好。註3：明明是把母愛／對母親的愛煉化成少女形象──這樣會令人「咦？」一聲的作法，因為他是「大概只懂得這麼做吧」的宮﨑駿，所以不曾讓人緊張。註4：兩次看《蒼鷺與少年》，我都覺得真人被蟾蜍纏上那一幕，少了一個（能看見全身的）遠景鏡頭在先，有點奇怪。"

Obviously any Studio Ghibli film is going to be great but I felt very connected to this film than others for some reason. Maybe that's because I attended the premiere which was amazing!This film just takes you on an adventure straight from the start. It has every Ghibli aspect you want in the best way possible. The voice acting was great, especially from The Gray Heron. The music was just beautiful and really set the scene for the film. The animation is one of the best I've seen from Ghibli with amazingly detailed backdrops to the complex movements of the characters that just look so fluid. Several times I got goosebumps from just the scenery alone.Only thing I felt is that the story got slightly confusing sometimes as well as the pacing just going on for a bit too long. I felt like the time we spent on several characters should have been used to show other characters who didn't have a lot of screen time.Once again I am so grateful to be one of the first people to see this in the UK. The premiere was amazing and it was just surreal seeing this film on a big screen. I will definitely be seeing it again on Boxing day if I can!"
